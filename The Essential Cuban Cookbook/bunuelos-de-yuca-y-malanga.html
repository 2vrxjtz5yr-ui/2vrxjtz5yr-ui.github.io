            <p>Would you believe that up until developing this cookbook, I had never made buñuelos? These light, airy fritters are a cross between a doughnut and a beignet. The Cuban version is usually made with yucca or a yucca/malanga (a root vegetable, commonly used in Cuban cuisine) pastry dough, giving them a delicious starchy texture. They are twisted, fried, shaped into a number 8 (which signifies good luck), and served with a sweet syrup or powdered sugar. I now regret not paying attention when my mom made these every year during the holidays. This version is adapted from a recipe by the famed Cuban chef, Nitza Villapol.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Variation Tip:</strong> Malanga (fresh or frozen) and sweet potatoes can also be used to make buñuelos in addition to the yucca, or as a replacement. Use equal parts of each vegetable to total 2 pounds.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 pounds yucca, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups sugar</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup water</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cinnamon sticks</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 star anise</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large egg</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon ground aniseed</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups canola oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a large Dutch oven or soup pot, combine 1 teaspoon of salt, the yucca, and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and immediately reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover the pot and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes until the yucca is fork-tender. Drain and press the yucca through a food mill or ricer, or mash with a potato masher. Spread the mixture evenly in a baking pan to cool at room temperature.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the sugar, water, and lemon zest. Bring to a boil and cook for 3 to 4 minutes until the sugar dissolves. Stir in the cinnamon sticks and star anise. Remove from the heat and set aside for at least 30 minutes for the flavors to develop.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a large bowl, whisk the egg, ground aniseed, and remaining 1 teaspoon of salt. Add the mashed vegetable mixture and whisk to combine, slowly adding the flour to form a smooth but slightly sticky dough.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dust a clean work surface with flour and transfer the dough to it. Roll the dough into a ½-inch-thick rope, then divide the rope into 6-inch pieces. Lightly dust the tops with flour. Shape each piece into a figure 8, adding flour to the work surface, as needed, to keep the dough from sticking.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottom pan, heat the oil to 375°F. Carefully add the buñuelos to the hot oil, working in batches of 3 or 4 pieces at a time. Deep fry for 3 to 4 minutes until golden, turning occasionally. Transfer the fried buñuelos to a wire cooling rack. Drizzle with the syrup and serve warm.</li>
