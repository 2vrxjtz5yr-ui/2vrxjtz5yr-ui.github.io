        <h1 itemprop="name">Corzetti with Red Bell Pepper Crema</h1>
        <p itemprop="description">A creamy red bell pepper sauce paired with handmade corzetti pasta, inspired by Ligurian traditions.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 red bell peppers</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon (15 ml) sherry vinegar</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 tablespoons (90 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound (454 g) corzetti dough (page 29), rolled into sheets about 1/16 inch (3 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces (113 g) Italian fiore di capra cheese (mold-ripened goat cheese)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol itemprop="recipeInstructions">
            <li itemprop="text">Roast the peppers whole on a grill, under a broiler, or right over the gas flame on your stove top, turning them several times, until completely blackened on all sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer them to a bowl, cover, and let steam for 10 to 15 minutes. Peel off and discard the skins, and then pull out and discard the cores and seeds.</li>
            <li itemprop="text">Put the roasted peppers and vinegar in a blender and blend until completely smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly add 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of the oil until the crema thickens. Taste the crema, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Use the crema within a few hours or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 2 days.</li>
            <li itemprop="text">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Using the base of a corzetti stamp or a round cutter 2½ inches (6 cm) in diameter, cut out circles of dough; you should have a total of 50 to 60 circles. Stamp each circle with the corzetti stamp to imprint its design. If you don’t have a stamp, leave the circles as they are. Or press the tines of a fork into them to imprint their shape. Repeat with the remaining pasta sheets.</li>
            <li itemprop="text">Dust the corzetti with flour, cover them, and use them within 1 hour or refrigerate them for up to 4 hours. You can also freeze them in a single layer, then transfer them to a zipper-lock bag, and freeze them for up to 1 month. Take the pasta right from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            <li itemprop="text">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the corzetti and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li itemprop="text">Meanwhile, pour the red pepper crema into a large, deep sauté pan with the remaining 2 tablespoons (30 ml) oil and a few grinds of black pepper. Add a few tablespoons (45 to 60 ml) of pasta water and cook over medium-high heat until the sauce is nice and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li itemprop="text">Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the pasta by lifting it to the pan of sauce. Toss and stir vigorously until the sauce reduces slightly and coats the pasta, about 1 minute. Add a little more pasta water if necessary to create a creamy sauce. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            <li itemprop="text">Dish out the corzetti onto warmed plates, placing them in concentric circles. Shave the fiore di capra over the top.</li>
        </ol>
