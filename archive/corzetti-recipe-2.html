            <p>This pasta always starts a conversation. People look at a design stamped on pasta and ask where it came from and who made the stamp. Years ago, Italian royalty had the family crest carved into corzetti stamps made from olive or walnut wood. Nowadays, gourmet stores in Italy sell all kinds of inexpensive stamps, but occasionally you find some beautiful antique ones for sale (look in Chiavari, a little town in Liguria). The pasta medallions are essentially flat and typically served with a creamy sauce like Liguria's classic basil pesto.</p>

            <strong>Pasta Swap:</strong> A wide, flat noodle holds a creamy sauce like a towel. Other wide, flat noodles like fazzoletti and maltagliati would be great here.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 red bell peppers</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon (15 ml) sherry vinegar</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 tablespoons (90 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound (454 g) Corzetti Dough (page 29), rolled into sheets about 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces (113 g) Italian fior di capra cheese (mold-ripened goat cheese)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Roast the peppers whole on a grill, under a broiler, or right over the gas flame on your stove top, turning them several times, until completely blackened on all sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer them to a bowl, cover, and let steam for 10 to 15 minutes. Peel off and discard the skins, and then pull out and discard the cores and seeds.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Put the roasted peppers and vinegar in a blender and blend until completely smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly add 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of the oil until the crema thickens. Taste the crema, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Use the crema within a few hours or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5 days.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Using the base of a corzetti stamp or a round cutter 2½ inches (6 cm) in diameter, cut circles of dough; you should have a total of 50 to 60 circles. Stamp each circle with the corzetti stamp to imprint its design. If you don't have a stamp, leave the circles as they are. Or press the tines of a fork into them to imprint their shape. Repeat with the remaining pasta sheets.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dust the corzetti with flour, cover them, and use them within 1 hour or refrigerate them for up to 4 hours. You can also freeze them in a single layer, transfer them to a zipper-lock bag, and freeze them for up to 1 month. Take the pasta right from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the corzetti and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, about 3 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, pour the red pepper crema into a large, deep sauté pan with the remaining 2 tablespoons (30 ml) oil and a few grinds of black pepper. Add a few tablespoons (45 to 60 ml) of pasta water and cook over medium-high heat until the sauce is nice and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the pasta by transferring it to the pan of sauce. Toss and stir vigorously until the sauce reduces slightly and coats the pasta, about 1 minute. Add a little more pasta water if necessary to create a creamy sauce. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the corzetti onto warmed plates, placing them in concentric circles. Shave the fior di capra over the top.</li>
        </ol>
