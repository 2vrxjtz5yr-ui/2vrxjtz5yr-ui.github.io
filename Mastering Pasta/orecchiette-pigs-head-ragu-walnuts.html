            <p>As noted earlier, the word orecchiette means "little ears," and the dimple helps capture sauce just like the dimples in our ears capture sound. In Puglia, they are often tossed with olive oil and broccoli rabe. Here, I'm playing with the textures. The semolina in the orecchiette has a slightly grainy feel in the mouth. The ground walnuts have a similar feel, and the two textures mingle in your mouth to the point where it's difficult to tell which is which. The chopped pork pieces have roughly the same shape as the orecchiette, but they have a softer texture and an incredibly rich flavor, which bring the whole dish together.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small pig's head, 4 to 5 pounds (1.8 to 2.3 kg)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 quarts (2.8 L) 3-2-1 brine (page 246)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 cups (1.4 L) water</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound (454 g) Orecchiette Dough (page 176)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (121 g) black walnuts</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons (148 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Sherry vinegar, for flavoring</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 bulbed spring onions, white and light green parts, cut into long, thin strips</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon (4 g) chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (25 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Rinse the pig's head and put it into a Dutch oven or other container just large enough to hold it and the brine. Pour the brine over the pig's head; the head should be completely submerged. Cover and refrigerate the pig's head for 3 days.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Pour out and discard 6 cups (1.4 L) of the brine from the Dutch oven. Add the water to the pan, again submerging the pig's head completely. (With this step, you are simply replacing half of the brine with water.) Place the pan over high heat and bring the liquid to a boil. Turn down the heat so the mixture is simmering gently, cover, and simmer the pig's head until the skin cracks and the meat is fall-apart tender, 3 to 3½ hours.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the pan from the heat and let the head cool in the liquid. Pick the meat from the head, discarding the bones, fat, and inedible pieces and chop the meat into bite-size pieces. Dig deep. There will be lots of good meat in the nooks and crannies. Use the meat within 1 hour or refrigerate it in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces and let them sit, covered, at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes before rolling them out. Roll out according to the instructions for your cavatelli maker. The dough should be cool but not cold. You can roll out the dough with a rolling pin or with a machine. If using a rolling pin, shape each piece into an oval and roll it on a floured surface into a circle about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick. If using a machine, shape each piece into an oval wide enough to fit the width of your pasta roller. Lightly flour your work surface and set the pasta roller to its widest setting. Lightly flour 1 piece of the dough, pass it through the roller, and then lightly dust the rolled dough with flour, brushing off the excess with your hands. Pass the dusted dough through the widest setting again. Set the roller to the next narrowest setting and pass the dough through, dusting again with flour and brushing off the excess. Pass once again through the roller. Fold the dough in half lengthwise and cut about ¼ inch (6 mm) off both corners at the fold. This folding and cutting helps to create an evenly wide sheet of dough. Continue passing the dough once or twice through each progressively narrower setting until you reach about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thickness.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cut the sheets crosswise into strips about ¾ inch (2 cm) wide. Cut each strip crosswise into pieces about ¾ inch (2 cm) square. Using a table knife or the side of your thumb, press and drag each square away from you across the work surface. The pasta will curl up on itself to form a dimpled, cupped shape. As the orecchiette are formed, transfer them to a generously floured rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. You should have about 300 orecchiette. Dust the pasta with flour, cover it, and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to 1 day. The texture is perfect after 1 day in the refrigerator. Or freeze the orecchiette in a single layer, transfer them to a zipper-lock bag, and freeze them for up to 2 weeks. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Toast the walnuts in a large, dry sauté pan over medium heat until fragrant and a few shades darker, about 5 minutes. Let cool, then grind to a coarse meal in a food processor.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the orecchiette and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain the pasta and reserve the pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the oil in a large, deep sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the pig's head meat and cook until it is crisp on the edges, about 5 minutes. Add the ground walnuts, the remaining ¼ cup (118 ml) oil, the spring onions, and parsley and toss to combine. Add the drained pasta and 1 cup (237 ml) of the pasta water and toss over medium heat until the sauce reduces slightly, gets creamy, and coats the pasta, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and add 1 tablespoon Parmesan to each pan. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt, pepper, and a few drops of sherry vinegar until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates, arranging them nicely on the plate. Garnish with Parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
