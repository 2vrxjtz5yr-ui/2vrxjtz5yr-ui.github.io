            <p>After this stock simmers, I like to smash up the shells to extract as much flavor as possible. Just whirl the whole mixture in a blender, and then strain it. We're not going for a subtle flavor here. You should get a strong taste of crab.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon (15 ml) grapeseed or canola oil</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 large blue crab shells</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (84 g) chopped yellow onion</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (61 g) chopped carrot</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (51 g) chopped celery</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (240 g) canned whole San Marzano tomatoes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oil in a stockpot over medium heat. Add the crab shells and sauté them, cracking the shells a little with a wooden spoon, until they are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the onion, carrot, and celery and sauté the vegetables until they are tender and lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the tomatoes, crushing them with your hand as you drop them into the pot, and scrape up any browned bits on the pan bottom. Raise the heat to medium-high and simmer the mixture until the liquid has reduced by about half, 5 to 10 minutes. Add enough water to cover the ingredients by about 1 inch (2.5 cm) and bring the liquid to a simmer. Turn down the heat to low and simmer the stock gently for 1 hour.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the pot from the heat and let the stock cool until it is warm. Line a medium-mesh sieve with cheesecloth. Working in batches, transfer the contents of the pot to a blender and blend until almost smooth. As each batch is blended, pass it through the prepared sieve, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquids as possible. Transfer the stock to a large container, and then label, date, and refrigerate it for up to 1 week or freeze it for up to 3 months.</li>
