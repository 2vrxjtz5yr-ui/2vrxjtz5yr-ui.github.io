            <p>Everyone loves tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil. The combination shows up on most Italian menus in some form or another. One summer, we got in the most beautiful heirloom tomatoes I'd ever seen. And we had some silky-smooth burrata in the cheese tray. We made lasagna, and it was magical. Just make sure your ingredients for this dish are high quality and super fresh. It won't taste like much made with cheap mozzarella and supermarket tomatoes. It also helps to serve this lasagna warm instead of piping hot. Good burrata and tomatoes should see only a small amount of heat.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 large heirloom tomatoes (about 4 lb/1.8 kg)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (8 g) chopped mixed fresh herbs (such as basil, flat-leaf parsley, and oregano)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">10½ ounces (300 g) burrata cheese</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ cups (12 oz/340 g) ricotta impastata cheese (see page 241)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (160 g) pitted and finely chopped Gaeta olives</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (227 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into sheets a little less than ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (25 g) grated Parmesan cheese, for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Have ready a bowl of ice water. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Using a small, sharp knife, score an X in the skin on the bottom of each tomato. Blanch the tomatoes in the boiling water until the skin on each begins to split and curl back a little from the X, 45 to 60 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, immediately transfer the tomatoes to the ice water and let them stand until cooled, a minute or two. Starting at the X, peel the skin from each tomato and discard it.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat a heavy cast-iron skillet over high heat until it is smoking hot. Add the tomatoes and sear, turning them now and then, until slightly charred all over, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the tomatoes to a cutting board and slice them very thinly, discarding the cores. It's okay if the slices fall apart a little. Season the slices with salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon (4 g) of the herbs.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Finely chop the burrata and transfer it to a bowl. Add the ricotta and olives, stir to mix well, and then season the mixture with salt and pepper.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the edges square. Cut the pasta into 4-inch (10 cm) squares. Repeat with the remaining sheets. You should get 8 to 10 squares from each sheet, or 16 to 20 squares total. As you work, lightly mist the pasta with water to keep it from drying out. Use the pasta squares immediately, or freeze them in a single layer, transfer them to a zipper-lock bag, and freeze them for up to 1 month. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Turn on the convection, if possible. Butter 6 individual baking dishes or a large rimmed baking sheet.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Have ready a large bowl of ice water. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches to prevent crowding, drop in the pasta squares and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Blanch the pasta for 15 to 20 seconds, stirring gently to prevent sticking. Using a spider strainer or tongs, immediately transfer the pasta squares to the ice water to stop the cooking. Lay the squares flat on clean kitchen towels or paper towels and pat them dry.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">To build the lasagna, lay 1 pasta square in each prepared baking dish or lay 6 squares in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, leaving 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) between the squares. Layer about ½ cup (118 ml) of the cheese-olive mixture and a few tomato slices on each pasta square. Top with a pasta square and repeat with the same amount of cheese-olive filling and tomato slices. Top with a pasta square, the remaining tomato slices, and a sprinkle of Parmesan.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bake the lasagna until it is very lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. The centers should just start to get warm. If the cheese overcooks, it will leak water and make the dish soggy.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer each lasagna to a warmed plate if baked on a baking sheet, or leave in the individual baking dishes. Garnish with the remaining herbs.</li>
        </ol>
