            <p>The great thing about pasta is that you can play around with it. Make up stuff. Why not use pasta sheets like a pizza crust, layer things on it and bake it? Boom—open lasagna is born. If you can't find smoked scamorza, use any good melty cheese with a smoky flavor, like smoked caciocavallo or smoked mozzarella.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces (114 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into a sheet a little less than ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (227 g) thick asparagus, trimmed of woody ends</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Unsalted butter, for searing cheese</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 ounces (85 g) smoked scamorza cheese, cut into 6 large slices, each about 4 inches (10 cm) square</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large chunk Parmesan cheese, for shaving</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 fresh mint leaves</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons (10 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon (5 ml) fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay the pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the edges square. Cut the pasta into 4-inch (10 cm) squares. You should have 6 usable squares. Use them immediately, or freeze them in a single layer, transfer them to a zipper-lock bag, and freeze them for up to 1 month. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Have ready a large bowl of ice water. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the pasta squares and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Blanch the pasta for 10 to 20 seconds. Using a spider strainer or tongs, transfer the pasta squares to kitchen towels or paper towels, laying them flat and patting them dry. They will be delicate and some may stick, but you should have plenty.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oven to 500°F (260°C). Turn on the convection, if possible. Butter 6 individual baking dishes or a small rimmed baking sheet.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Using a mandoline or vegetable peeler, shave the top half of each asparagus spear lengthwise into very thin slices. Reserve the bottom halves of the spears.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. When it is very hot, grease the pan with a little butter, then, working in batches if necessary to prevent crowding, add the scamorza slices and sear, turning once, until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta square in each prepared baking dish, or lay all 6 squares in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, leaving 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) between the squares. Lay the asparagus slices over the cheese, placing them side by side.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bake the lasagna until lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, cut the bottom halves of the asparagus spears on the diagonal into ½-inch (12 mm) pieces. Place the pieces in a bowl. Shave 6 large slices of Parmesan into the bowl. Stack the mint leaves, roll them up lengthwise, and cut crosswise into very thin slices (chiffonade). Add the mint to the bowl along with the oil and lemon juice. Toss the salad gently and then taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer each open lasagna to a warmed plate if baked on a baking sheet, or leave in the individual baking dishes. Top each serving with some of the asparagus salad.</li>
        </ol>
