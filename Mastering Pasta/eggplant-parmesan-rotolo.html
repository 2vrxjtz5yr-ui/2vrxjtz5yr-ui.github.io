            <p>Mike Deganis is our chef de cuisine at Osteria New Jersey. He was at Osteria in Philadelphia for a few years, then at Alla Spina, where we had only a few baked pasta dishes on the menu. Mike lived in South Philly at the time, and on his days off, he always went to the old Italian restaurants and ordered eggplant parmesan. He created this version of eggplant parmesan for Alla Spina. And it was a hit.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 slices good-quality sandwich bread or other good-quality white bread, crusts removed if thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 tablespoons (90 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 globe eggplants (about 2 pounds/907 g total)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 sprigs thyme</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces (114 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into a sheet about 1⁄16 inch (1.5 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 ounces (170 g) buffalo mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (50 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (118 ml) tomato sauce (page 244)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (15 g) fresh oregano leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Turn off the oven and put the bread directly on the oven rack. Let the bread dry out for at least 8 hours or up to overnight in the turned-off oven. To reduce the bread to coarse crumbs, pass it through a food mill fitted with the large die, or, using short pulses, process the bread in a food processor.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the bread crumbs and toast them, stirring or shaking the pan a few times, until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Set aside.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise and score each half in a large crosshatch pattern with a sharp knife. Set the eggplants, cut side up, on a rimmed baking sheet and season the flesh with salt and pepper. Strip the leaves from the thyme sprigs onto the eggplant, then drizzle the eggplant evenly with the remaining 4 tablespoons (60 ml) olive oil.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Roast the eggplants until very tender and golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Let the eggplants cool slightly, then scoop the flesh from the skins into a food processor. Using short pulses, coarsely puree the flesh. Reserve the puree.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the entire pasta sheet and blanch it for 30 seconds, stirring and separating it with tongs to keep the sheet from sticking to itself. Carefully remove the pasta sheet and lay it out on kitchen towels or paper towels. Trim the edges square.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Spread the eggplant puree evenly over the entire sheet of pasta, all the way to the edges. Top the eggplant evenly with the mozzarella and ¼ cup (25 g) of the Parmesan, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Starting from a short side, tightly roll up the sheet. The rotolo should look like a jelly roll.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oven to 500°F (260°C). Spread the tomato sauce in the bottom of a shallow 2-quart (2 L) baking dish, or for individual servings, spread 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the sauce in the bottom of each of four 2-cup (473 ml) baking dishes. Using a sharp plain-edged or serrated knife, trim the ends of the rotolo, then cut it crosswise into four slices, each about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Lay the slices flat in the baking dish(es) and sprinkle the bread crumbs and the remaining ¼ cup (25 g) Parmesan evenly over the slices.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bake the rotolo until heated through and lightly browned on top, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer the rotolo slices to warmed plates if baked in a single dish, or leave in the individual baking dishes. Garnish each serving with some of the oregano.</li>
        </ol>
