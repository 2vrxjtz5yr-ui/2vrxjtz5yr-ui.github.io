            <p>The pasta here is a store-bought shape that resembles the fleshy top of a rooster's head. To match it, I usually make the ragù with goose. But a goose weighs about 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and makes a ton of ragù. So I simplified the recipe for home cooks by using duck instead. Of course, if you're serving a crowd, go for the goose! D'Artagnan (see Sources, page 249) sells geese if you can't find one from your local farmer.</p>

            <strong>PASTA SWAP:</strong> You could easily sub a long strand pasta like fettuccine or tagliatelle.
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 duck (about 5 lb/2.25 kg)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ red onion, cut into large pieces</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small carrot, peeled and cut into large pieces</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 celery stalks, cut into large pieces</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (237 ml) dry red wine</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 juniper berries</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small clove garlic, smashed</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 to 4 cups (710 to 946 ml) duck stock (page 242)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (227 g) store-bought cockscomb pasta (creste di gallo)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (28 g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 ounces (170 g) Castelmagno cheese, grated (about 1½ cups), plus some for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the giblets from the duck and reserve them for another use. Cut the leg-thigh portions from the duck by pulling each leg away from the body, finding the leg to find the joint, and then driving your knife straight through the joint. Remove the breasts by cutting slits on either side of the breastbone and then working the knife carefully around the rib cage, keeping the knife against bone at all times and pulling the breast meat from the carcass. Reserve the carcass to make duck stock.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Separate the legs from the thighs by driving a cleaver straight through the joint. Cut the breasts in half. Season the duck pieces all over with salt and pepper, and then place them, skin side down, in a single layer, in a large, deep braising pan (or 2 pans, if necessary). Slowly cook the duck over medium-low heat, turning the pieces now and then, until all of the fat is rendered out and the skin is golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer the duck pieces to a plate. Strain and reserve the rendered fat for another purpose (it will keep frozen for 8 to 10 months—duck fat is great for frying potatoes!).</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oven to 300°F (150°C). Return the pan to medium heat, add the onion, carrot, and celery, and cook until the vegetables are soft but not browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the wine and simmer until the liquid has reduced by about half. Tie the juniper and garlic in a cheesecloth bundle and add the bundle to the pan along with the duck pieces. Add enough stock to come about three-fourths of the way up the sides of the duck pieces, cover the pan, and braise the duck in the oven until it is very tender, about 1½ hours.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the pan from the oven and let the duck cool in the pan. When the duck pieces are cool enough to handle, pull the meat from the bones, discarding the skin and bones. Set the meat aside. Remove and discard the cheesecloth bundle. Skim off any excess fat from the surface of the braising liquid and then pass the vegetables and liquid through a food mill fitted with the medium die, or pulse them briefly in a food processor just until the vegetables are very coarsely chopped. The ragù should be somewhat chunky and not puree. Return the meat to the ragù, and then taste the mixture, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. If the ragù seems dry, thin it with a little more duck stock.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the cockscomb pasta and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, heat the ragù in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the pasta by transferring it to the pan of ragù. Add the butter and cheese and toss and stir until the sauce reduces slightly and coats the pasta, 1 to 2 minutes. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates and top with more cheese.</li>
        </ol>
