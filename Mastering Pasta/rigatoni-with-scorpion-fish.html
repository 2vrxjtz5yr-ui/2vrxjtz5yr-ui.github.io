            <p>Scorpion fish, often considered bycatch or "trash fish," makes this a very special plate of pasta. It's a tough fish to find. But make the effort and you won't be sorry. Scorpion fish bones also make the best fish stock. If you can't find scorpion fish, monkfish makes a good substitute.</p>

            <strong>Pasta Swap:</strong> I used to use paccheri for this dish, so that would be my first choice for a substitute.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1¼ pounds (567 g) Extruded Semolina Dough</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Semolina, for dusting</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (237 ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ yellow onion, finely chopped</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 clove garlic, smashed</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pint (283 g) cherry or grape tomatoes, halved lengthwise</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 canned whole San Marzano tomatoes</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups (473 ml) fish stock, preferably made with scorpion fish bones</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (227 g) scorpion fish fillets, skinned and finely chopped</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Pinch of red pepper flakes</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon (4 g) chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Fit your pasta extruder or stand-mixer attachment with the chilled rigatoni plate. If using a pasta extruder, set it to medium speed. If using a stand mixer, with the machine running on medium speed, feed the dough into the hopper in marble-size clumps, using a pushing tool to push the clumps into the auger, being careful not to overload it. As the pasta is extruded, cut it into ½-inch (4 cm) lengths and immediately dust it with semolina to prevent sticking.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dry the pasta by placing it on wire racks that will fit in your refrigerator and refrigerate it uncovered for at least 8 hours or up to 4 days. The pasta will get drier and harder as it sits. I like the texture after 2 days in the refrigerator. For more bite, dry the pasta with a humidifier as described on page 120, and then store it in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 month.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the rigatoni, cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil, and cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 4 to 5 minutes (8 to 10 minutes for fully dried boxed pasta). Drain the pasta and reserve the pasta water.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are tender, about 4 minutes. Add the cherry tomatoes and cook until the tomatoes soften and start to fall apart, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the canned tomatoes, crushing them with your hand as you add them to the pan. Continue cooking, stirring a few times, until the canned tomatoes break down, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the stock, bring the liquid to a simmer, and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove and discard the garlic. Add the fish, pepper flakes, parsley, and drained pasta to the pan, tossing until the sauce reduces slightly, gets creamy, and coats the pasta, 3 to 4 minutes, adding a little pasta water if necessary to create a creamy sauce. Keep the pasta moving until the fish turns white and the pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates.</li>
        </ol>
