    <h1>Taleggio Ravioli with Radicchio, Honey, and Walnuts</h1>
    <p class="yield">Makes 4 servings</p>
    
    <div class="intro">
        <p>This dish came about one fall, after serving a cheese plate featuring Taleggio accompanied with shaved radicchio, walnuts, and honey as condiments. I thought . . . hmm . . . maybe we can put all of this together in one dish. It worked perfectly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>DOUGH SWAP</strong> I would stick to softer doughs here. Chestnut Dough (page 145) would be awesome. It would be like serving a cheese plate with chestnut bread.
    </div>

    <div class="ingredients">
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>7 ounces (200 g) Taleggio cheese</li>
            <li>⅓ cup (120 g) mascarpone cheese</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>8 ounces (227 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into sheets about ⅟₃₂ inch (0.8 mm) thick</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (15 g) walnuts</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (21 g) finely chopped yellow onion</li>
            <li>3 cups (110 g) julienned radicchio</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon (15 ml) honey, plus some for drizzling</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the Taleggio and mascarpone in a food processor and puree until the cheeses are smooth. Taste the mixture, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Add the egg and process until blended. Spoon the filling into a zipper-lock bag, seal closed, and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.</li>
            <li>Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the edges square. Fold the sheet in half crosswise and cut a small notch at the fold to mark the center of the sheet. Unfold the sheet so it lies flat again. Snip a corner from the bag of filling and pipe ⅜-inch (1 cm) balls of filling in two rows along half the length of the sheet, leaving a ½-inch (4 cm) margin between the balls and stopping about 1½-inches (4 cm) from the center mark of the sheet. Lightly mist the dough with water to keep it from drying out and to help create a good seal. Lift up the empty side of the sheet and fold it over the balls of filling. Use your fingers to press out the air around each ball. Using a round cutter (preferably fluted) 1½ to 2 inches (4 to 5 cm) in diameter, punch out ravioli along the rows. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. As the ravioli are formed, transfer them to floured rimmed baking sheets. You should have 30 to 40 ravioli.</li>
            <li>Cover the ravioli and use them within 1 hour, or freeze them in a single layer on floured rimmed baking sheet, transfer them to zipper-lock bags, and freeze them for up to 2 weeks. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches to prevent crowding, drop in the ravioli and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a low boil. Gently cook the ravioli until they are tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, toast the walnuts in a large, dry sauté pan over medium heat, shaking the pan now and then, until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the nuts to a cutting board and chop them. Heat the oil in the same pan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the onion and sweat it until it is soft but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the radicchio and cook until it is tender but still a little crunchy, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the honey.</li>
            <li>Dish out the radicchio mixture onto warmed plates, placing it to the side of each plate. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the ravioli, letting them drip-dry for a moment. Arrange the drained ravioli on the other side of each plate. Drizzle the ravioli with honey and sprinkle with the walnuts.</li>
        </ol>
