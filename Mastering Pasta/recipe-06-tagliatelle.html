            <p>How traditional is tagliatelle in Bologna? In the 1970s, the mayor of Bologna approved a law specifying that the noodles for authentic tagliatelle Bolognese must measure exactly 8 mm (⅝ inch) when cooked and served. There is even a gold tagliatella of regulation size in the Bologna Chamber of Commerce. The vegetables should be very finely cubed (called brunoise) for this dish. If you like, chop them in a food processor, using short pulses just until the vegetables are finely chopped. If you don't have a meat grinder, use preground beef and veal. Or, you can partially freeze the two meats as directed and then pulse them in a food processor until finely chopped but not pureed. If veal shoulder isn't available, use any fatty cut of veal from the shoulder, leg, or belly. And don't forget the milk. The meat soaks it up, creating a nice creamy texture and pretty red-orange color.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Pasta Swap:</strong> Bolognese sauce is thick enough to cling to anything. You can twirl it with spaghetti and it gets wound up among the noodles. Or you can toss it with rigatoni and it gets caught inside the tubes. Use whatever pasta you want here.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">5¼ ounces (150 g) beef chuck, cubed</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">5¼ ounces (150 g) veal shoulder, cubed</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 tablespoons (85 g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons (45 ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ yellow onion, minced</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small carrot, peeled and minced</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 celery stalks, minced</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2¼ ounces (78 g) pancetta, finely chopped</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (118 ml) dry red wine (such as Sangiovese, Barbera, or whatever you'll be drinking with the meal)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (120 g) whole canned San Marzano tomatoes</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">About 2 cups (473 ml) veal stock (page 242) or beef stock (page 242)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (118 ml) milk, heated to a boil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces (340 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into sheets about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¾ cup (75 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Put a bowl and all of the parts of a meat grinder in the freezer for 20 minutes. Put the beef and veal cubes in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and freeze the meat until partially frozen, about 20 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Grind the cold meats on the medium die of the chilled meat grinder into the cold bowl and reserve.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat 3 tablespoons (43 g) of the butter and all of the olive oil in a large, deep sauté pan over medium-high heat. When the butter begins to foam, add the onion, carrot, celery, and pancetta and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables and pancetta begin to brown, 4 to 5 minutes. A little color adds a nice flavor here. Add the ground meats and continue cooking, breaking up the meats with a spoon, until they brown a little. Pour in the wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits on the pan bottom and cooking until the liquid almost evaporates, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, crushing them with your hands as you add them to the pan. Cook for a few minutes, then add enough of the stock to barely cover the ingredients. Turn the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until the tomatoes break down completely and the flavors are blended, about 45 minutes. If the stock completely evaporates, add a little more stock, a few spoonfuls at a time.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the milk and cook until the milk nearly evaporates and disappears into the meat, 5 to 7 minutes. Taste the sauce, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Cover and keep warm over low heat or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days. (If refrigerated, reheat the sauce before proceeding.)</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the edges square. Dust the sheet with flour, brushing off the excess, and then fold the sheet in half lengthwise to make the sheet narrower. Fold it in half again lengthwise to make it even narrower. Using a sharp knife, cut the dough crosswise into slices about ¼ inch (6 mm) wide. Dust the pasta with flour, and then pick up the strands and drop them onto the work surface to dust them all over with the flour. Coil the strands into nests and place them on a floured rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining sheets. Cover the pasta and use it within 1 hour or refrigerate it for up to 4 hours. You can also freeze the pasta in an airtight container for up to 1 month. Take the pasta right from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the tagliatelle and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, add 1 cup (237 ml) of the pasta water and the remaining butter to the sauce and cook over medium-high heat until the liquid reduces slightly and starts to get creamy, 5 to 7 minutes. Using a spider strainer or tongs, drain the pasta by transferring it to the sauce in the pan. Toss and stir vigorously until the sauce becomes creamy and coats the pasta, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in ½ cup (50 g) of the Parmesan. Keep the pasta moving until the cheese melts and pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates and garnish with the remaining Parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
