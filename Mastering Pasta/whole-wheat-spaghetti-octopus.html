            <p>Stefano Arrigoni, the owner of Osteria della Brughiera restaurant in Villa d'Almè, near Bergamo, told me that the aroma of wheat goes great with octopus. I had to try it, and he was absolutely right. See for yourself. It's a simple dish, so every ingredient counts. Even the mineral water used to braise the octopus adds to the briny, mineral flavor.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Pasta Swap:</strong> Use any whole wheat pasta here, such as the Farro Semolina Dough (page 121) extruded into spaghetti or bucatini. Or use Whole Egg and Whole Wheat Dough (page 29) and cut it into fettuccine.
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (227 g) Whole Wheat Semolina Dough (page 121)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Semolina, for dusting</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ pounds (680 g) octopus</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Rock salt, for cleaning octopus</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (237 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (118 ml) sparkling mineral water, preferably San Pellegrino, or more if needed</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small clove garlic, smashed</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Fit your pasta extruder or stand-mixer attachment with the spaghetti plate. Set the extruder to medium speed; if using a stand-mixer attachment, feed the dough into the extruder in marble-size clumps, using a pushing tool to push the clumps through the extruder. The first few clumps may come out uneven; just throw them away. Continue gradually dropping marble-size clumps into the extruder and pushing them through, being careful not to overload it. As the pasta is extruded, cut it into 9-inch (23 cm) lengths and immediately dust it with semolina to prevent sticking.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dry the pasta by placing it on wire racks that will fit in your refrigerator and refrigerate it uncovered for at least 8 hours or up to 4 days. The pasta will get drier and harder as it sits. The texture is perfect after 2 days in the refrigerator.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">To clean the octopus, insert your fingers into the body and turn it inside out. Scrape away and discard the ink sac and other innards and then rinse the body well. Turn the body right side out. Remove and discard the eyes and black mouth, or beak, located at the center where the tentacles meet the body. Scrub the tentacles very well with rock salt, rinse, and repeat until you are sure the tentacles are clean. Scrubbing with salt also breaks down the muscle fibers a bit to make the octopus more tender.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place the octopus in a pot just big enough to accommodate it. Add the oil, sparkling water, and garlic, adding a little more sparkling water if necessary to cover the octopus. Bring the liquid to 180°F (82°C) over medium-high heat, then lower the heat to maintain the temperature at a steady 180°F (82°C). Braise the octopus uncovered at 180°F (82°C) until it is tender, about 1½ hours.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the pan from the heat and let the octopus cool in the liquid. Once it is cool, transfer the octopus to a cutting board and chop it into bite-size pieces. Reserve the braising liquid. To prepare the octopus ahead of time, leave it whole in the braising liquid and refrigerate it for up to 1 day, then chop it when you are ready to serve the pasta.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the spaghetti and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain the pasta and reserve the pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer the drained pasta to a large, deep sauté pan along with ¾ cup (177 ml) of the octopus braising liquid and ¼ cup (60 ml) of the pasta water. Place the pan over medium heat and stir in the chopped octopus and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the lemon juice. Toss until the sauce reduces slightly, gets creamy, and coats the pasta, 1 to 2 minutes. Add a little more braising liquid and/or pasta water if necessary to create a creamy sauce. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt, pepper, and up to 1 tablespoon (15 ml) additional lemon juice until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates.</li>
        </ol>
