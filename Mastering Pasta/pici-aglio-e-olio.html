            <p>Pici are like thick, hand-rolled spaghetti. The noodle is so thick, chewy, and delicious, you don't want to cover it up with much else. Aglio e olio (garlic and oil) is just right. I use garum—essentially Roman fish sauce, also known as colatura di alici or anchovy extract—to punch up the flavor. It has a complex umami character from the fermented fish. You can buy garum online from Buon Italia (see Sources, page 249), or substitute a good-quality Asian fish sauce like Three Crabs brand. As for a garnish, don't even consider it. This dish is about simplicity. Parmesan would be sacrilege!</p>

            <strong>Pasta Swap:</strong> You could roll the same dough into strozzapreti, but the method here is so unique, and the dough is really best for pici.
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound (454 g) Pici Dough (page 175)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup plus 1 tablespoon (252 ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Semolina or cornmeal, for dusting</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">10 cloves garlic, cut into matchsticks</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 to 2 teaspoons (1.8 to 3.5 g) red pepper flakes</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 to 4 tablespoons (45 to 60 ml) garum or good-quality Asian fish sauce</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ tablespoons (6 g) chopped mixed fresh herbs (parsley, oregano, and thyme are nice)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick and about 18 inches (46 cm) square. Rub the surface of the dough square with about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the oil, coating it evenly. The oil enriches the dough and keeps it from drying out as you work.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Pour a pile of semolina or cornmeal near the corner of the work surface. Cut the dough square into strips ¾ to 1 inch (2 to 2.5 cm) wide. Starting at one end of a strip, use the heel of your palm to roll the strip gently back and forth on the work surface, stretching it lengthwise until it forms a rope about ¼ inch (6 mm) in diameter (see photo, page 174). If necessary, rub a little water on the work surface to help the rope stick and roll more easily. As you roll, set the shaped portion of the rope into the semolina or cornmeal pile to prevent it from sticking to itself. You should end up with a rope 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8 m) long in the pile of semolina or cornmeal. Pick up one end of the rope, drape it around a finger, and then continue to drape the entire rope around your fingers. Place the rope in parallel lines on a rimmed baking sheet dusted with semolina or cornmeal. Repeat with the remaining dough. Use the pici immediately or cover them and let them stand at room temperature for up to 2 hours. You can also freeze them in a single layer, transfer them to a zipper-lock bag, and freeze them for up to 1 month. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the pici and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 cup (237 ml) oil in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until aromatic but not brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in 1 teaspoon of the pepper flakes and 3 tablespoons of the garum.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Using tongs, drain the pasta by transferring it to the pan of sauce. Reserve the pasta water. Add 1½ cups (296 ml) of the pasta water to the pan and stir vigorously over medium-high heat until the sauce emulsifies slightly, gets creamy, and coats the pasta, 2 to 3 minutes. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding more pepper flakes and garum until it tastes good to you. Stir in the herbs.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates.</li>
        </ol>
