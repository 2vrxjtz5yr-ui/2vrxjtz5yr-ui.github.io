            <p>Bouillabaisse inspired this combination. Butter, fennel, saffron, orange—I can't get enough of those flavors. And the bone marrow ties them all together. You'll need about 2 pounds (907 g) veal marrowbones. Slide out the marrow as directed in the marrowbone stock on page 242 and then use the bones to make the stock.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Pasta Swap:</strong> Saffron Semolina Dough is important to the flavor in this dish, but it can be shaped into short pasta. Try fusilli or rigatoni.
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (227 g) Saffron Semolina Dough (page 121)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Semolina, for dusting</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 ounces (170 g) fennel bulbs, trimmed</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon (14 g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 ounces (85 g) bone marrow, finely chopped</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ teaspoons (1 g) saffron threads</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ to 2 cups (355 to 473 ml) marrowbone stock (page 242)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon (4 g) julienned or chopped fresh basil or flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ teaspoons (3 g) grated orange zest</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (50 g) grated Parmesan cheese, plus some for garnish</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Fit your pasta extruder or stand-mixer attachment with the gnocchi sardi (malloreddus) plate. Set the extruder to medium speed; if using a stand-mixer attachment, feed the dough into the extruder in marble-size clumps, using a pushing tool to push the clumps into the auger. The first few clumps may come out uneven; just throw them away. Continue gradually dropping marble-size clumps into the extruder and pushing them through, being careful not to overload it. As the pasta is extruded, cut it into ¾-inch (2 cm) lengths and immediately dust it with semolina to prevent sticking.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">You can also shape the pasta by hand. Form the dough into a ball, adding a little water if necessary, then cut the ball into a few pieces. On a lightly floured work surface, roll each piece into a rope about ⅜ inch (1 cm) in diameter, then cut each rope crosswise into ¼-inch (6 mm) pieces. Roll each piece on a grooved gnocchi board or on the back of fork tines to create a ridged oval shape similar to, though a little shorter than, cavatelli.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dry the pasta by placing it on wire racks that will fit in your refrigerator and refrigerate it uncovered for at least 8 hours or up to 4 days. The pasta will get drier and harder as it sits. The texture is perfect after 2 days in the refrigerator.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the gnocchi sardi and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, shave the fennel into thin strips, preferably on a mandoline—even a handheld one. Heat the butter in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. Add the fennel and sweat it until it is tender but not browned, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the pasta by transferring it to the pan. Add the bone marrow, saffron, 1½ cups (355 ml) of the stock, the basil, and the orange zest to the pan. Toss over medium heat until the sauce reduces slightly, gets creamy, and coats the pasta, 2 to 3 minutes. If necessary, add the remaining ½ cup (118 ml) stock to create a creamy sauce. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the Parmesan, and keep the pasta moving until the cheese melts and pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out onto warmed plates and garnish with Parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
