            <p>In some Italian restaurants, lardo seems to be the new butter. One day I had it whipped on crusty toast and thought it would make a great ravioli filling. Instead of cured lardo, I ground fatback and pancetta in a food processor along with coriander, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves—the same seasonings used to cure lardo. It was fantastic. The warming spices seemed to call for shaping the pasta into cappelletti, which are popular on Christmas Day in central Italy. Cappelletti means "little hats," and they resemble tortellini but are larger and contain more filling. To take it over the top, add a few thin strips of lardo along with the pecorino.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 ounces (170 g) pancetta, finely chopped</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 ounces (170 g) pork fatback, finely chopped</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon (3 g) kosher salt, plus a little more for seasoning</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">⅛ teaspoon (0.3 g) freshly ground black pepper, plus some for garnish</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Pinch of ground coriander</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Pinch of ground cinnamon</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Pinch of ground cloves</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces (340 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into sheets about 1/32 inch (0.8 mm) thick</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fava Crema</h3>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ pounds (680 g) young fava beans in the pod</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¾ cup (158 ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons (10 ml) sherry vinegar</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (42 g) finely chopped yellow onion</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small chunk pecorino cheese, for grating</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        
        <h3>Make the Filling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a bowl, stir together the pancetta, fatback, salt, pepper, coriander, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Spread the mixture in a single layer on a small rimmed baking sheet or cutting board and freeze the mixture until it is very cold, about 20 minutes. Put the blade of a food processor in the freezer at the same time.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Fit the food processor with the cold blade and process the cold pancetta mixture until it is smooth, scraping down the sides a few times. It should become a thick, pale pink paste, and you should have about ¾ cup. Spoon the filling into a zipper-lock bag, seal closed, and use it immediately or refrigerate it for up to 2 days.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Shape the Cappelletti</h3>
        <ol start="3">
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the edges square. Snip a corner from the bag of filling and, starting at each of the long edges, pipe ½-inch (12 mm) balls of filling in two rows down the entire length of the sheet, leaving a 1½-inch (4 cm) margin around each ball of filling (3 inches/7.5 cm total between rows). Lightly mist the dough with water to keep it from drying out and to help create a good seal. Fold the long edge of the pasta closest to you over one row of filling. Fold the opposite long edge over the other row of filling. Use your fingers to press out the air around each ball of filling. Using a round cutter (preferably fluted) 2 to 2½ inches (5 to 6 cm) in diameter, cut out half-moons by positioning the cutter halfway over the filling. Take the two pointed ends of each cutout and pinch them together around the straight side of the filling to make a cone shape resembling a little hat. Dab with a little water between the points to seal (see photos, page 95). Repeat with the remaining pasta and filling. As the cappelletti are formed, transfer them to floured rimmed baking sheets. You should have 50 to 60 cappelletti.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cover the cappelletti and use them within 1 hour or refrigerate them for up to 4 hours. You can also freeze them in a single layer, transfer them to zipper-lock bags, and freeze them for up to 2 weeks. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Make the Fava Crema</h3>
        <ol start="5">
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Have ready a bowl of ice water. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Shell the fava beans and discard the pods, and blanch the beans in the boiling water for 1 minute. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, transfer the beans to the ice water to stop the cooking. Pinch open the pale green skin on each bean and pop out the bright green fava. You should have about 1½ cups (340 g) of peeled favas. Toss ½ cup (57 g) of the favas with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the oil and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of the vinegar. Taste the salad, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Use the salad within 2 hours or cover it and refrigerate for up 6 hours.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Put the beaker of a blender in the freezer. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the oil in a sauté pan over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring now and then, until it is soft but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes. There should be no color on the onion. Add the remaining 1 cup (113 g) favas and enough water to barely come to the top of the ingredients. Turn up the heat to high, and as soon as the water simmers, remove the pan from the heat. Pour the mixture into the chilled blender beaker, stirring to cool it down.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">When cooled, puree the mixture, adding the remaining ½ cup plus 2 teaspoons (128 ml) oil through the opening in the lid, until the mixture is smooth and emulsified, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon (5 ml) vinegar and blend until incorporated. Taste the crema, adding salt, pepper, and additional vinegar until it tastes good to you. The crema should be bright green and very smooth, and you should have about 1½ cups (355 ml). Use it within 1 hour or refrigerate it in an airtight container for up to 1 day.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Cook and Serve</h3>
        <ol start="8">
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches to prevent crowding, drop in the cappelletti and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a low boil. Gently cook the pasta until they are tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a spider strainer, drain the pasta by transferring it to a clean kitchen towel.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, heat the fava crema in a small saucepan over low heat until it is warm, but do not let it simmer. Smear a few tablespoons (45 to 60 ml) of warm crema on each plate and place 10 to 15 cappelletti over the crema. Spoon the fava bean salad over the cappelletti, and then grate pecorino over each serving. Garnish with a grind or two of pepper and a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
