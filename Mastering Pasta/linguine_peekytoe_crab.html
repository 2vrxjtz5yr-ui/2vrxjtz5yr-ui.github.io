        <h1>Linguine with Peekytoe Crab and Horseradish</h1>
        <p class="servings">Makes 4 servings</p>
        
        <p>I guess it's pretty obvious that I like pasta with fish. Peekytoe crabs have sweet, pink meat and a delicate, briny flavor that plays nice with fresh horseradish. The crabs are caught in waters twenty to forty feet (6 to 12 m) deep in traps baited with bits of fish. They're different from Jonah crabs, but you could substitute Maine, stone, or Dungeness crabmeat as long as it's fresh and unpasteurized.</p>

            <strong>PASTA SWAP:</strong> Any short pasta will do here. Try rigatoni or penne.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>12 ounces (340 g) Extruded Semolina Dough</li>
                <li>Semolina, for dusting</li>
                <li>1 cup (237 ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons (10 ml) fresh lemon juice</li>
                <li>8 ounces (227 g) peekytoe crabmeat, picked over to remove any shells and cartilage</li>
                <li>¼ cup (16 g) chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 knob fresh horseradish, for grating</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="instructions">
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Fit your pasta extruder or stand-mixer attachment with the chilled linguine plate. If using a pasta extruder, set it to medium speed. If using a stand mixer, with the machine running on medium speed, feed the dough into the hopper in marble-size clumps, using a pushing tool to push the clumps into the auger, being careful not to overload it. As the pasta is extruded, cut it into 9-inch (23 cm) lengths and immediately dust it with semolina to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Dry the pasta by placing it on wire racks that will fit in your refrigerator and refrigerate it uncovered for at least 8 hours or up to 4 days. The pasta will get drier and harder as it sits. I like the texture after 2 days in the refrigerator. For more bite, dry the pasta with a humidifier as described on page 120, and then store it in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 month.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the linguine, cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil, and cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 4 to 6 minutes (8 to 10 minutes for fully dried boxed pasta). Drain the pasta and reserve the pasta water.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, combine the oil, lemon juice, and 1 cup (237 ml) of the reserved pasta water in a large, deep sauté pan over high heat. Bring the liquid to a simmer and cook it until it reduces slightly in volume, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn down the heat to low, add the drained pasta, and toss and stir vigorously until the sauce reduces slightly, gets creamy, and coats the pasta, about 1 minute. Add the crabmeat and parsley and keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing, 1 to 2 minutes, adding more pasta water as necessary to create a creamy sauce. Taste the mixture, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
                <li>Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates and use a Microplane or other fine-rasp grater to generously garnish each serving with finely grated horseradish.</li>
