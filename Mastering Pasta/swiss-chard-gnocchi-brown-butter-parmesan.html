        <p itemprop="description">I see gnocchi made with spinach and potato quite a bit. It's a great combination. But spinach isn't the only green leafy vegetable out there. Swiss chard adds a little more flavor.</p>

    <div class="ingredients">
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 russet potato (12 oz/340 g)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces (112 g) Swiss chard</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (50 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">⅓ cup (76 grams) tipo 00 flour, or ⅓ cup plus 2 tablespoons (76 g) all-purpose flour, plus some for dusting</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">⅛ teaspoon grated nutmeg</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (114 g) unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Combine the potato (unpeeled) and salted water to cover by 1 inch (2.5 cm) in a saucepan. Cover, bring the water to a boil over high heat, and boil until a knife slides easily in and out of the potato, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the pan from the heat and transfer the potato to a cutting board. Reserve the potato water in the pan. Peel off and discard the potato skin (wear gloves if necessary). Coarsely chop the potato, and then pass it through a potato ricer or a food mill fitted with the fine die onto a large, lightly floured cutting board or smooth work surface, covering the board or surface with the potato. (Spreading out the potato helps to evaporate moisture.) Let stand for 5 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, return the potato water to a boil and set up a bowl of ice water. Remove and discard the tough stems and ribs from the Swiss chard, and then blanch the leaves in the boiling water for 3 minutes. Immediately transfer the chard leaves to the ice water to stop the cooking. Transfer the chard to a colander and press out most of the water. Transfer the chard to a food processor and pulse until finely chopped.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Spread the chard evenly over the surface of potato. Scatter 1 tablespoon (6 g) of the Parmesan, the flour, and the nutmeg evenly over the top. Season the mixture with salt and pepper, and then use a bench scraper to cut all of the seasonings into the potatoes, repeatedly scraping and mixing the ingredients until they are blended. Taste the mixture, adding more salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Use the bench scraper to stir in the egg just until the dough comes together.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Knead the dough on a lightly floured work surface for 3 to 4 minutes. It will be soft. Flour the bench scraper or a knife and cut the dough into 4 pieces. Roll each piece on the floured surface into a long rope about ½ inch (12 mm) in diameter. Using the floured bench scraper or knife, cut the ropes crosswise into ½-inch (12 mm) pieces. As the gnocchi are formed, transfer them to a generously floured rimmed baking sheet and shake the baking sheet to dust the gnocchi with the flour. You should have about 100 gnocchi.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Use the gnocchi immediately or cover them loosely and refrigerate them for a few hours. You can also freeze them in a single layer, transfer them to a zipper-lock bag, and freeze them for up to 2 weeks. Take the gnocchi straight from the freezer to the boiling water, adding 30 seconds or so to the cooking time.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Melt the butter in a sauté pan over medium heat and cook until the liquid looks golden and the milk solids brown on the bottom of the pan, 6 to 8 minutes. Keep warm over low heat.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the gnocchi and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a low boil. Gently cook the gnocchi until springy to the touch and tender throughout, 3 to 5 minutes. Squeeze a dumpling between your fingers. It should have some bounce-back. If it just flattens, the gnocchi are not done yet.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the gnocchi, letting them drip-dry for a moment, then dish them out onto warmed plates. Spoon the brown butter over the top. Garnish with the remaining Parmesan.</li>
