            <p>If you find a very traditional trattoria in Rome, you might be lucky enough to try pagliata. It's a classic Roman preparation that calls for veal intestines that still have milk in them. You tie the ends closed, and then cook the intestines in tomato broth. They become very tender, and when you bite into them, the curdled milk squirts out. It is one of the greatest things that I have ever put into my mouth. You'll never find those innards in the United States, so I make the sauce with veal sweetbreads, milk, and tomato instead. I pair it with a pasta shape called cappellacci dei briganti, or "brigands' hats." This shape resembles the headgear of Italian outlaws who opposed the unification of Italy in the 1800s. It's a whimsical pairing of pasta and sauce. At the time that I developed the dish, we'd just gotten some new plates at the restaurant in the style of Victor Emmanuel, the first king of the newly united Italy. Only the finest of Roman pasta dishes could make the treaty between the brigands and the French-speaking king; hence, the pagliata with brigands' hats.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces (340 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into sheets about 1⁄16 inch (1.5 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces (114 g) veal sweetbreads, preferably thymus</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ red onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (60 g) whole canned San Marzano tomatoes</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups (710 ml) whole milk</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (25 g) grated pecorino romano cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a sheet of pasta on a lightly floured work surface. Using a round cutter 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter, cut the dough into rounds. To shape each piece of pasta (see photos, page 184), pick up a dough round and place it on your index finger so that your finger is about ½ inch (12 mm) from the top of the circle. Wrap the circle around your finger, overlapping one side of dough over the other, and pressing the fold gently against your finger to seal it. Turn your finger so the seam is in the back. The pasta should look like a witch's hat with a slightly longer "brim" in the front. Fold that brim up onto the hat, gently pressing it against your finger so the front of the brim stays pressed up against the tall part of the hat. Repeat the process with each dough round, placing the pieces on a floured rimmed baking sheet and dusting them with flour. Repeat with the remaining dough. You should have 60 to 70 pieces. Cover the pasta loosely and use it within 2 hours, or freeze it in a single layer, transfer it to an airtight container, and freeze it for up to 1 month. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Rinse the sweetbreads in cold water, then soak them in a bowl of ice water for 10 minutes. (Organs spoil easily, so it's important to keep the sweetbreads cold right up until you cook them.) Drain them, pat dry, and carefully remove the outer membrane and sinew. Slice the sweetbreads into strips 3 inches (7.5 cm) long.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and sweat them until they are soft but not browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, crushing them with your hand as you add them to the pan, and cook them, stirring occasionally, until they start to break down, about 5 minutes. Add the sweetbreads and milk and bring the mixture to just below a simmer. Turn the heat down to low and braise the mixture until the milk curdles and the sauce thickens, developing a consistency that resembles ricotta cheese, 30 to 40 minutes. Taste the sauce, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the cappellacci dei briganti and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the pasta by transferring it to the sauce in the pan. Toss over medium heat until the sauce reduces slightly, reemulsifies and gets creamy, and coats the pasta, 1 to 2 minutes. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates and garnish with the pecorino.</li>
        </ol>
