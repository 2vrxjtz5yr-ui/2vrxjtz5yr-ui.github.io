            <p>You can pickle just about any vegetable with this recipe. Just change the spices to match the vegetable. If you're pickling dense vegetables like carrots or turnips, cook them a little longer to make sure the pickles are not too hard. And if you're pickling cucumbers, trim off the ends of the cucumbers. That step avoids an enzyme that causes pickles to soften.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups (710 ml) distilled white vinegar</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups (473 ml) water</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (50 g) sugar</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ tablespoons (13 g) kosher salt</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ tablespoons (14 g) coriander seeds</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ teaspoon (0.5 g) black peppercorns</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic, halved</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 small bay leaves, each broken in half</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 pounds (907 g) red onions (about 4), peeled and quartered lengthwise</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Set up a boiling-water canner by bringing a large stockpot of water to a boil. Drop a wire rack into the bottom of the pot, then, using tongs, a jar lifter, or silicone gloves, immerse 4 pint (473 ml) jars and their two-part canning lids (flat metal lid and screw band) into the boiling water, resting them on the rack. Boil the jars and lids for 5 minutes. Remove the jars and lids from the water and keep them warm.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, combine the vinegar, water, sugar, salt, coriander seeds, peppercorns, garlic, and bay in a saucepan and bring the liquid to a boil over high heat. Add the onions to the hot pickling liquid and simmer them over medium heat until they are slightly tender but still very crunchy, 1 to 2 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the onion quarters to the warm jars, standing them upright packing them in snugly. Ladle the liquid, including some spices, garlic, and bay, into each jar, filling to within ⅛ inch (3 mm) of the rim. Wipe the rims clean, put on the lids, and tightly attach the screw bands.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, return the water in the canner to a boil. Using tongs, a jar lifter, or heatproof silicone gloves, immerse the sealed jars in the boiling water, resting them on the rack. Boil for 10 minutes.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the jars and let them cool completely on a wire rack. As the jars cool, the centers of the lids should get sucked down. To test the lids once the jars have cooled, press on the center of each lid, which should feel firm, not flexy. If a lid feels flexy and makes a noise, immerse the jar in the boiling water for another 5 minutes. If the seal is still not good, refrigerate the jar and use the pickles within 3 weeks.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Store the cooled jars in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year. Once you have opened a jar, refrigerate it and use the pickles within 3 weeks.</li>
        </ol>
