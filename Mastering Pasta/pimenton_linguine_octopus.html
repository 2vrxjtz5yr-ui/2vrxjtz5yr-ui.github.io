                <p>I like making chorizo salumi and enjoy Spanish dishes using pata negra (cured Ibérico ham). I thought, why not make spaghetti with pimentón (Spanish smoked paprika)? Then, the dish just fell into place. The ham broth is made with a leftover Ibérico ham bone. You can ask a local Spanish restaurant for one after they've cut all the ham from the bone. Just bend the lower part of the leg and cut through the knee joint. You only need the lower leg bone to make the broth, which is then used to simmer the pasta instead of plain water. Or, you can make the broth with a leftover ham bone from a baked ham.</p>

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 Ibérico ham bone, cut through the knee joint</li>
                    <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ pounds (567 g) baby octopuses</li>
                    <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Rock salt, for cleaning octopuses</li>
                    <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (267 ml) olive oil</li>
                    <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (118 ml) sparkling mineral water, preferably San Pellegrino</li>
                    <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ small clove garlic, smashed</li>
                    <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (227 g) Pimentón Dough, rolled into sheets about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick</li>
                    <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (8 g) chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
                    <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                    <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (20 g) Marcona almonds, chopped</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="instructions">
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place the lower portion of the ham bone in a large pot; reserve the other bone for another use or discard. You will need a pot that is at least 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter. A deep, heavy roasting pan or braising pan will also work. Add water to cover the bone. Bring the water to a simmer over medium heat, turn down the heat to low, and gently simmer the bone for 12 hours. Remove the pot from the heat and let the bone cool to room temperature in the liquid. Discard the bone and strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve. Use the ham broth within 1 hour, refrigerate it in an airtight container for up to 3 days, or freeze it for up to 1 month.</li>
                    <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">To clean the octopuses, insert your fingers into the bodies and turn them inside out. Scrape away and discard the ink sacs and other innards, and then rinse the bodies well. Turn the bodies right side out. Remove and discard the eyes and black mouth, or beak, located at the center where the tentacles meet the body. Scrub the tentacles very well with rock salt, rinse, and repeat until you are sure the tentacles are clean. This breaks down the muscle fibers a bit so the octopuses become more tender. Set the octopuses aside.</li>
                    <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place the heads and tentacles in a pot just big enough to accommodate them. Add 1 cup (237 ml) of the olive oil, the sparkling water, and the garlic. Bring the liquid to a simmer over medium-high heat, then lower the heat to maintain a steady temperature of 180°F (82°C). Braise the octopuses uncovered at 180°F (82°C) until they are tender, about 1½ hours.</li>
                    <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the pan from the heat and let the octopuses cool in the liquid. Once they are cool, transfer the octopuses to a cutting board and chop them into bite-size pieces. Reserve the braising liquid.</li>
                    <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the edges square. Cut the sheet into 9-inch (23 cm) lengths. Fit your stand mixer or pasta machine with the linguine cutter and set it to medium speed. Feed 1 length of dough at a time through the cutter, dusting the dough lightly with flour as it is cut into strands. Form the linguine into nests and set them on a floured rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with any remaining dough. Use the linguine within 1 hour or freeze it in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the sauce (the pasta cooks directly in the sauce).</li>
                    <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Combine the octopus, 1 cup (237 ml) of the ham broth, the remaining 2 tablespoons (30 ml) oil, and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the octopus braising liquid in a large, deep sauté pan. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat and simmer until the liquid reduces slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the pasta and parsley and simmer until the pasta absorbs a fair amount of the liquid and tastes tender but is still a little chewy when bitten, 2 to 3 minutes, adding a little more braising liquid if necessary. Toward the end of the cooking, toss the pasta and the remaining liquid in the pan until the liquid reduces slightly, gets creamy, and coats the pasta, 1 to 2 minutes. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
                    <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates and top with the chopped almonds.</li>
                </ol>
