            <p>For the record, the Italian word farfalle means "butterflies," not bow ties. And homemade farfalle are softer and more delicate than dried ones, so they need a lighter sauce. This one works great because the favas and bits of chorizo get caught up in the folds of the pasta. In this dish, I prefer the smooth texture of Pantaleo cheese, a hard, aged goat cheese from Sardinia. Look for Pantaleo at cheese shops or well-stocked supermarkets such as Whole Foods. Or substitute fiore sardo or another aged, firm goat's or sheep's milk cheese for grating.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Pasta Swap:</strong> Even though this sauce has bits of sausage and beans, the overall taste is light and fresh. Fazzoletti or fettuccine would work well here.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ pounds (680 g) young fava beans in the pod</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (227 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into sheets about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces (340 g) soft Spanish chorizo</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">⅓ cup (60 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">⅓ cup (56 g) finely chopped yellow onion</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (113 g) grated Pantaleo cheese</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Have ready a large bowl of ice water. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Shell the beans, discard the pods, and blanch the beans in the boiling water for 1 minute.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, transfer the beans to the ice water to stop the cooking. Pinch open the pale green skin on each bean to release the bright green fava. You should have about 1½ cups (170 g) peeled favas. Use them within 1 hour or cover and refrigerate for up to 8 hours.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the edges square. Cut the sheet into 2 by 1-inch (5 by 2.5 cm) rectangles, preferably with a fluted cutter to create a ruffled edge on the two short sides of each rectangle (these will be the opposite ends of each "butterfly"). To form each farfalla (see photos, page 44), place your index finger in the center of a rectangle and place your thumb and middle finger on the straight edges of the rectangle on opposite sides of your index finger. Your fingers and thumb should be lined up in a row parallel with the ruffled edges of the rectangle. Pinch your thumb and middle finger toward your index finger in the center, keeping your index finger in place to help create the folds. As the pasta folds up, remove your index finger and firmly pinch the folds of pasta together in the center to hold the shape. The ruffled edges should remain unpinched. Place the farfalla on a floured rimmed baking sheet and dust with a little flour. Repeat with the remaining pasta rectangles. You should have 60 to 70 farfalle. Cover the pasta and use it within 1 hour or refrigerate it for up to 4 hours. You can also freeze them in a single layer, transfer them to a zipper-lock bag, and freeze them for up to 1 month. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cut each chorizo in half lengthwise, then cut crosswise into half-moons about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick. Heat the oil in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onion and sweat until soft but not browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chorizo and favas and cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a bowl. Drop in the farfalle, in batches if necessary to prevent crowding, and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, about 2 minutes. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the pasta by transferring it to the pan of sauce. Reserve the pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add about 1 cup (240 ml) of the pasta water to the pan and cook the mixture over medium-high heat, tossing and stirring vigorously, until the sauce reduces slightly, becomes creamy, and coats the pasta, about 1 minute. Add a little more pasta water if necessary to create a creamy sauce. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in ¾ cup (85 g) of the cheese. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates and garnish with the remaining Pantaleo cheese and a grind of pepper.</li>
        </ol>
