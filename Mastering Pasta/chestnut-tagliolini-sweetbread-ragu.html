            <p>A visit to Strand Book Store in New York City inspired this dish. I was looking at books from the Renaissance that had all these pictures of people eating noodles with different kinds of ragù. A few leaps of the mind later, this dish was born.</p>

            <p><strong>PASTA SWAP:</strong> Any long pasta like fettuccine, spaghetti, or even pappardelle works with this ragù.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound (454 g) Chestnut Dough (page 145), rolled into sheets about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (225 g) veal sweetbreads, preferably thymus</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Tipo 00 or all-purpose flour, for dusting sweetbreads</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">⅓ cup (60 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 clove garlic, smashed</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (114 g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 sprig thyme, plus 3 tablespoons (8 g) fresh thyme leaves</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups (473 ml) veal stock (page 242)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (100 g) grated Parmesan cheese, plus some for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the edges square. Cut the sheet into 10-inch (25 cm) lengths. Fold each length in half lengthwise over itself, then fold in half lengthwise again. Julienne each folded piece crosswise into thin strips about ⅛ inch (3 mm) wide. You should end up with long strands that resemble square spaghetti. Dust the strands with flour and place them in nests on a floured rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. Use the tagliolini within 1 hour or freeze it in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Rinse the sweetbreads in cold water, then soak them in a bowl of ice water for 10 minutes. (Organs spoil easily, so it's important to keep the sweetbreads cold right up until you cook them.) Drain them, pat dry, and carefully remove the outer membrane and sinew. Cut the sweetbreads into ½-inch (12 mm) pieces. Season them all over with salt and pepper, then dust them with flour, gently shaking off the excess. You want to remove as much flour as possible.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oil in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook it until it is golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and discard the garlic, and then add 2 tablespoons of the butter and the thyme sprig. When the butter is foamy, add the sweetbreads and cook them, turning them a few times, until they are crispy on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes. Pour in 1 cup (237 ml) of the stock, bring it to a simmer, and simmer until reduced by about half and thickened into a sauce, 6 to 8 minutes more. Remove and discard the thyme sprig. Use the ragù within 1 hour or refrigerate it in an airtight container for up to 1 day.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the tagliolini and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain the pasta and reserve the pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the remaining 1 cup stock, 4 tablespoons of the remaining butter, and 1 cup (237 ml) of the pasta water to the sweetbread ragù. Simmer the mixture until it has reduced by about one-third and starts to thicken, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the drained pasta and toss until the sauce reduces a little more, gets creamy, and coats the pasta, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and add the thyme leaves, the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, and the Parmesan, tossing until the cheese melts and pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out onto warmed plates and garnish with Parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
