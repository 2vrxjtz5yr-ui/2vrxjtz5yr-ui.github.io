            <p>I love the idea of two complementary flavors in one ravioli. Lamb and polenta is just one combination. Use your imagination to come up with other types of double ravioli. For the cheese here, I like Calcagno, a firm, white cheese made from the milk of sheep that graze on wild herbs and grasses on the hillsides of Sardinia. The cheeses are sent to Salerno Province on the Italian mainland, where they are aged in the caves of the Madaio family. If you can't find it, substitute another firm, tangy aged pecorino. And for the lamb, hind shanks work great. Each one weighs a bit more than a pound, and they're less expensive than shanks cut for osso buco.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Dough Swap:</strong> Whole Egg, Bread Flour, and Stone-Ground Wheat Dough would work nicely here. The bite in that dough would match both the lamb and the polenta.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>Lamb Ragù and Filling</h3>
        <ul>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (59 g) mascarpone cheese</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (25 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pasta</h3>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces (340 g) Egg Yolk Dough, rolled into sheets between ⅟₁₆ inch and ⅟₃₂ inch (1.5 and 0.8 mm) thick</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (120 ml) veal stock</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Make the Lamb Ragù</h3>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Remove and discard any sinew from the lamb shanks. Season them all over with salt and pepper, and then dust them with flour, shaking off the excess. Melt the butter in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When it is hot and bubbly, add the shanks and sear them until they are deeply browned all over, 10 to 12 minutes total. Transfer the shanks to a plate.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lower the heat to medium, add the onion, carrot, and celery, and cook the vegetables, stirring occasionally, until they are deeply browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Pour in the wine, raise the heat to high, bring the wine to a boil, and boil until reduced by about half, 6 to 8 minutes. Return the shanks to the pan and add enough water to come three-fourths of the way up the sides of the shanks. Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat, then turn down the heat to low, cover, and braise in the oven until the meat is so tender that it easily pulls off the bone, 2 to 3 hours.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the pan from the oven and let the contents cool in the pan. When they are cool enough to handle, remove 1 shank and set it aside for the filling. Remove the second shank, pull the meat from the bone, and shred or chop the meat into bite-size pieces. Discard the gristle, fat, and bone. Pass the vegetables and braising liquid through a food mill fitted with the large die, or, using short pulses, pulse them in a food processor just until the vegetables are finely chopped but not pureed. If the resulting mixture is thin and watery, return it to the pan and boil it until it has reduced to a thick consistency similar to that of tomato sauce.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the shredded meat to the pan, mix with the braising mixture, and then taste the ragù, adding salt and pepper to taste. You should have about 3 cups (710 ml) ragù. Use the ragù within 2 hours or transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to 3 days or freeze it for up to 1 month.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Make the Lamb Filling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the meat from the reserved shank and discard the gristle, fat, and bones. Grind the meat with a meat grinder fitted with the small die, capturing it in a bowl. Alternatively, using short pulses, chop the meat in a food processor just until it is finely chopped but not pureed, then transfer it to a bowl. Mix in the cheese and herbs and then taste the mixture, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Stir in the egg. You should have about 2 cups of filling. Spoon the filling into a zipper-lock bag or pastry bag, seal closed, and refrigerate it for 1 hour or up to 2 days.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Make the Polenta Filling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Combine the polenta, mascarpone, and 2 tablespoons (12 g) of the Parmesan in a food processor and process until combined. Taste the filling, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Fold in the remaining cheese. Add the egg and process until blended. Spoon the mixture into a zipper-lock bag or pastry bag, seal closed, and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Shape the Ravioli</h3>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the edges square. Fold the sheet in half crosswise and cut a small notch at the fold to mark the center of the sheet. Unfold the sheet so it lies flat again. Snip a corner from each bag of filling and pipe the fillings in columns ¼ inch (6 mm) wide and about 3 inches (8 cm) long along the length of the sheet, alternating the fillings and leaving a ½-inch (12 mm) margin around each column. Pipe the same number of lamb-filling columns as polenta-filling columns and stop the columns about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the center mark. Lightly mist the dough with water to keep it from drying out and to help create a good seal. Lift up the empty side of the sheet and fold it over to cover the fillings. Use a dowel or a clean round pencil to firmly press between each column of filling and neaten up the columns. Press the dowel across the end of the columns to seal, making the filling about 3 inches (7.5 cm) long. Using a fluted cutting wheel, cut along the same areas you just sealed with the dowel. Then cut between every second column of filling. Each ravioli should measure 3 by 2 inches (7.5 by 5 cm) and have two columns of filling. Repeat with the remaining pasta and fillings. As the ravioli are formed, transfer them to floured rimmed baking sheets. You should have 35 to 45 ravioli.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cover the ravioli and use them within 1 hour. You can also refrigerate them for up to 4 hours, or freeze them in a single layer until frozen solid, transfer them to zipper-lock bags, and freeze them for up to 2 weeks. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Cook and Serve</h3>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches to prevent crowding, drop in the ravioli and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a low boil. Gently cook the ravioli until they are tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, divide the stock between two large, deep sauté pans over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon (15 g) butter and ¼ cup (60 ml) pasta water to each pan and cook until reduced and thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the ravioli as you transfer them to the pans. Toss gently, and then divide the ragù evenly between the pans and cook until the sauce reduces slightly and coats the pasta, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pans from the heat and add 1 tablespoon Parmesan to each pan. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates, arranging them nicely on the plate. Garnish with Parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
