            <p>Figs and blue cheese love each other. But go easy on the cheese. Too much pungency can ruin this dish. I prefer a mild Gorgonzola here. And for the sweet fig and onion filling, caramelle is the perfect shape. With twists of pasta on either edge of the filling, these ravioli resemble wrapped caramel candies.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Dough Swap:</strong> For another layer of flavor, use Cocoa Dough (page 145). The slight bitterness harmonizes well with the sweet figs, onions, and cheese.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (30 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 yellow onions, sliced into half-moons</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces (340 g) ripe Mission figs (about 16 figs), stemmed and halved lengthwise</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 sprigs rosemary</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (30 g) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (50 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces (340 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into sheets about 1⁄32 inch (0.8 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">⅓ cup (78 ml) heavy cream</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 ounces (142 g) Gorgonzola dolce cheese, crumbled</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Best-quality extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the olive oil a large, deep sauté pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add the onions, shaking the pan to distribute the hot oil. Lower the heat to medium and cook the onions, stirring occasionally, until they shed their water and go from translucent to light golden brown to deep caramel brown, 25 to 35 minutes. Stir in a little water now and then if necessary to keep the onions from burning on the bottom. You should end up with about ½ cup caramelized onions. Scrape the onions into a food processor or blender.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the same pan over high heat until it is smoking hot. Add the figs, cut side down, and sear, slipping the sprigs among the figs. Sear the figs until they are very soft and caramelized golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the butter and shake the pan until it melts and is evenly distributed. Discard the rosemary sprigs, and then transfer the contents of the pan to the processor or blender along with the Parmesan. Puree the fig-onion mixture until smooth, stopping to scrape down the container once or twice (it will be thick). Taste the mixture, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Transfer the filling to a zipper-lock bag or pastry bag, seal closed, and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the ends square. Lightly mist the dough with water to keep it from drying out, and then cut the dough into 2-inch (5 cm) squares. Snip a corner from the bag and pipe ½-inch (12 mm) balls of filling near the bottom of each square. Wet your fingers and moisten the corners of a square. Fold the bottom of the pasta over the filling so the edge just covers the filling. The enclosed and the filled pasta forms a small rectangle. Gently twist the ends of the dough like a candy wrapper and pinch the edges to seal (see photos, page 84). Repeat with the remaining pasta and filling. As the caramelle are formed, transfer them to floured rimmed baking sheets. You should have about 200 caramelle.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cover the caramelle and refrigerate them for up to 2 hours, or freeze them in a single layer on floured rimmed baking sheets, transfer them to zipper-lock bags, and freeze them for up to 2 weeks. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches to prevent crowding, drop in the caramelle and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a low boil. Gently cook the caramelle until they are tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the Gorgonzola until it melts and the fonduta is smooth. Keep it warm over the lowest possible heat.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Spoon a pool of the fonduta onto each warmed plate. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the caramelle, letting them drip-dry for a moment. Arrange them on the fonduta. Grind some black pepper over each serving and drizzle some olive oil around the plates.</li>
        </ol>
