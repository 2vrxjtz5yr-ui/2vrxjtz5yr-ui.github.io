            <p>Have you ever had that popular cold pasta salad with lobster, tomato, and parsley? I never liked it. Here's an improvement on the combination, one with a little more finesse. Make sure you get female lobsters with their roe. The roe is dark green, almost black—not to be mistaken for the lighter green tomalley. The roe turns red when cooked, and that's part of what makes this dish special.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (227 g) Saffron Semolina Dough (page 121)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Semolina, for dusting</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 live female lobsters (about 1½ lb/680 g each)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">⅓ cup (114 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 large, ripe tomato</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 leek, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced into half-moons</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (30 ml) Pernod</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ teaspoon (0.1 g) saffron threads</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 small sprigs herbs (basil, oregano, or flat-leaf parsley)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Fit your pasta extruder or stand-mixer attachment with the chilled fusilli plate. If using a pasta extruder, set it to medium speed. If using a stand mixer, with the machine running on medium speed, feed the dough into the hopper in marble-size clumps, using a pushing tool to push the clumps into the auger, being careful not to overload it. As the pasta is extruded, cut it into 2-inch (5 cm) lengths and immediately dust it with semolina to prevent sticking.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dry the pasta by placing it on wire racks that will fit in your refrigerator and refrigerate it uncovered for at least 8 hours or up to 4 days. The pasta will get drier and harder as it sits. The texture is perfect after 2 days in the refrigerator.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Have ready a bowl of ice water. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. To prepare the live lobsters for cooking as painlessly as possible, put 1 lobster on a cutting board and uncurl the tail so the lobster lies flat against the board. Position the tip of a chef's knife just behind the head and press down firmly until the knife tip reaches the cutting board. Then bring the blade down between the eyes to finish the cut. Repeat with the second lobster. Add the lobsters to the boiling water and blanch for 30 seconds. Using tongs, immediately transfer the lobsters to the ice water to stop the cooking. Reserve the water in the pot.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the meat from the lobster shells and cut into bite-size pieces. Reserve the dark green lobster roe (coral) that lies near the tail. You can refrigerate the blanched lobster meat in an airtight container for up to 4 hours.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer the lobster roe (about 2 tablespoons) and 6 tablespoons (85 g) of the butter to a small food processor and process until the mixture is smooth. You can also make this lobster butter with a fork and a strong arm. Use the lobster butter within 1 hour or refrigerate it in an airtight container for up to 4 hours.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Return the large pot of water to a boil and replenish the ice in the ice water. Using a small, sharp knife, score an X in the skin on the bottom of the tomato. Blanch the tomato in the boiling water until the skin begins to split and curl back a little from the X, 30 to 60 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, immediately transfer the tomato to the ice water and let it stand until cooled, a minute or two. Starting at the X, peel the skin from the tomato and discard it. Cut the tomato in half through its equator, turn each half cut side down over a bowl, and squeeze gently to remove the seeds and gel (you can use your fingers or the tip of a knife to help dig out the seeds and gel). Discard the contents of the bowl. Cut out the core from each tomato half, then finely dice the tomato. This preparation is called tomato concassé. Set the tomato concassé aside. Reserve the water in the pot.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons (28 g) butter in a large, deep sauté pan over medium-low heat. Add the leek and sweat it until it is soft but not browned, about 10 minutes. Add the Pernod and saffron threads and cook until the liquid evaporates, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, return the large pot of water to a boil and salt it for pasta. Drop in the fusilli, cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil, and cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 4 to 5 minutes. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the pasta by transferring it to the pan of sauce. Reserve the pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the tomato concassé, lobster meat, lobster butter, and herbs to the pan. Toss over medium heat until the sauce gets creamy and coats the pasta, 1 to 2 minutes, adding a little pasta water if necessary to create a creamy sauce. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates.</li>
        </ol>
