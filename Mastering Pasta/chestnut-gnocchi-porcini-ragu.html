            <p>There's no egg in these dumplings, so they're very delicate. That means you have to be extra careful when you cook them. Keep them at a gentle simmer instead of a vigorous or even low boil, so they don't fall apart. You'll be rewarded with a superlight texture and just a hint of sweet chestnut. Of course, you could use an egg instead of the oil, but I prefer the taste without the egg. And if you can't find fresh porcini, use whole chanterelle mushrooms.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound (454 g) yellow or gold potatoes, such as Yellow Finn or Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (106 g) chestnut flour, sifted</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (76 g) tipo 00 flour, or ½ cup plus 2 tablespoons (76 g) all-purpose flour, plus some for dusting</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons (45 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">⅛ teaspoon (0.3 g) freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ red onion, minced</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 clove garlic, smashed</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 thyme sprigs</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ pounds (680 g) porcini mushrooms, sliced if large</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (30 ml) dry white wine</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups (473 ml) chicken stock (page 242)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (25 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Combine the potatoes (unpeeled) and salted water to cover by 3 inch (2.5 cm) in a saucepan. Cover, bring the water to a boil over high heat, and boil until a knife slides easily in and out of the potatoes, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the pan from the heat and transfer the potatoes to a cutting board. Immediately peel off and discard the skins. Wear gloves if the potatoes feel too hot to handle. Coarsely chop the potatoes, and then pass them through a potato ricer or a food mill fitted with the fine die onto a large, lightly floured cutting board or smooth work surface, covering the board or surface with the potatoes. (Spreading out the potatoes helps to evaporate excess moisture.) Sprinkle both flours, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the oil, and the nutmeg evenly over the potatoes. Season with about ½ teaspoon (1.5 g) salt and ¼ teaspoon (0.5 g) pepper. Using a bench scraper, cut the layered ingredients into the potatoes, repeatedly scraping, cutting, and mixing until the dough comes together.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Gently knead the dough just until it has a uniform consistency, 1 to 2 minutes. Be careful not to overwork the dough or it will develop excess gluten, which will make the gnocchi tough. Flour the bench scraper or a knife and cut the dough in half. Roll each half on the floured surface into a long rope about ½ inch (12 mm) in diameter. Use the floured bench scraper or knife to cut the rope crosswise into ½-inch (12 mm) pieces. Gently roll a cut side of each piece on a lightly floured ridged gnocchi board (or on the clean comb or the tines of a fork) to notch the exterior and create an oval shape. As the gnocchi are formed, transfer them to a generously floured rimmed baking sheet and shake the sheet pan to dust the gnocchi with the flour. You should have about 175 gnocchi.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Use the gnocchi within 1 hour or cover them loosely and refrigerate them for up to 8 hours. You can also freeze the gnocchi in a single layer, transfer them to a zipper-lock bag, and freeze them for up to 2 weeks. Take the gnocchi straight from the freezer to the boiling water, adding 30 seconds or so to the cooking time.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Have ready a bowl of ice water. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop the gnocchi into the boiling water and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a low boil. Adjust the heat so that the water simmers, stirring gently. Cook the gnocchi until springy to the touch and tender throughout, 3 to 5 minutes. Squeeze a dumpling between your fingers. It should have some bounce-back. If it just flattens, the gnocchi are not done yet. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, immediately transfer the gnocchi to the ice water and let them sit in the water for 30 seconds to stop the cooking. Transfer the gnocchi to dry kitchen towels and pat them dry.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons (30 ml) oil in a large deep, sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and thyme and sweat the onion until it is soft but not browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook until they release some of their liquid and shrink a little, about 5 minutes. Pour in the wine and cook until the wine evaporates, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in the stock and bring the mixture to a simmer. Adjust the heat so that the mixture simmers gently, and then simmer to blend the flavors, 15 to 20 minutes. Taste the ragù, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the gnocchi to the ragù, shaking the pan until the gnocchi are well coated and heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Discard the thyme and garlic, and then dish out the gnocchi onto warmed plates. Garnish with the Parmesan.</li>
