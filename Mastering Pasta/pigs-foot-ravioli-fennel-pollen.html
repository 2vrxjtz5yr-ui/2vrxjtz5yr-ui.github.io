    <h1>Pig's Foot Ravioli with Fennel Pollen</h1>
    <p class="yield">Makes 4 servings</p>
    
    <div class="intro">
        <p>Brad Spence, the chef at Amis, blew me away with this one. When he first described the dish to me, there were so many layers of flavor that I didn't think it would work. But it does . . . perfectly. Just make sure you taste the filling as you're making it. The dry mustard, Parmesan, and nutmeg should all be in balance to complement the pork. The orange zest and fennel pollen, a spice collected from the flowers of wild fennel plants, add beautiful color and aroma to the sauce. Dialing in the seasonings here should give you the confidence to create some incredible flavor combinations of your own.</p>

        <strong>DOUGH SWAP</strong> For a more tender, delicate result, use Rich Egg Yolk Dough (page 29).

    <div class="ingredients">
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1¾ cups (170 g) kosher salt, plus some for seasoning</li>
            <li>¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons (170 g) sugar</li>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        
        <h3>Cure and Braise the Pig's Foot</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the salt, sugar, pepper, coriander, and garlic in a large bowl. Chop the leaves from 1 sprig rosemary and add them to the bowl. Add the pig's foot, toss to coat, and then bury the pig's foot in the cure as best you can. Cover the bowl and refrigerate it overnight.</li>
            <li>The next day, rinse off the cure and put the pig's foot in a large pot. Add the bay leaf, the remaining rosemary sprig, and just enough water to barely cover the ingredients. Bring the liquid to a simmer over medium heat, and then lower the heat so that the liquid simmers very slowly. Cover and cook at a bare simmer until the meat pulls easily off the bone, 2 to 2½ hours. During the last 30 minutes of cooking, add the pork shoulder and cook it until it is no longer pink in the center.</li>
            <li>Drain the mixture in a colander and discard the bay leaf and rosemary. When the pig's foot is cool enough to handle, pick the skin and meat from the bones, digging for the soft fat, meat, and skin. Discard any really tough or rubbery tendons or gristle and discard all of the bones. Put the pig pickings and pork shoulder in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and freeze them for 20 minutes to firm them up. Put all of the parts of a meat grinder in the freezer at the same time.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Make the Filling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Grind the cold pig's foot pickings and pork shoulder on the small die of the meat grinder into a large bowl. (If you don't have a meat grinder, you can grind them in a food processor, using short pulses, until very finely chopped but not completely pureed.) Stir in the Parmesan, mustard, and nutmeg, and then taste the mixture, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Stir in the egg. If the filling looks too thick to pipe, mix in a little water. You should have about 1¾ cups filling. Spoon the filling into a zipper-lock bag, seal closed, and use immediately or refrigerate it for up to 1 day.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Shape the Ravioli</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the edges square. Fold the sheet in half crosswise and cut a small notch at the fold to mark the center of the sheet. Unfold the sheet so it lies flat again. Snip a corner from each bag of filling and pipe the fillings in columns ¼ inch (6 mm) wide and about 3 inches (8 cm) long along the length of the sheet, alternating the fillings and leaving a ½-inch (12 mm) margin around each column. Pipe the same number of lamb-filling columns as polenta-filling columns and stop the columns about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the center mark. Lightly mist the dough with water to keep it from drying out and to help create a good seal. Lift up the empty side of the sheet and fold it over to cover the fillings. Use a dowel or a clean round pencil to firmly press between each column of filling and neaten up the columns. Press the dowel across the end of the columns to seal, making the filling about 3 inches (7.5 cm) long. Using a fluted cutting wheel, cut along the same areas you just sealed with the dowel. Then cut between every second column of filling. Each ravioli should measure 3 by 2 inches (7.5 by 5 cm) and have two columns of filling. Repeat with the remaining pasta and fillings. As the ravioli are formed, transfer them to floured rimmed baking sheets. You should have 35 to 45 ravioli.</li>
            <li>Cover the ravioli and use them within 1 hour. You can also refrigerate them for up to 4 hours, or freeze them in a single layer until frozen solid, transfer them to zipper-lock bags, and freeze them for up to 2 weeks. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Cook and Serve</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches to prevent crowding, drop in the ravioli and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a low boil. Gently cook the ravioli until they are tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, divide the stock between two large, deep sauté pans over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon (15 g) butter and ¼ cup (60 ml) pasta water to each pan and cook until reduced and thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the ravioli as you transfer them to the pans. Toss gently, and then divide the ragù evenly between the pans and cook until the sauce reduces slightly and coats the pasta, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pans from the heat and add 1 tablespoon Parmesan to each pan. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan.</li>
            <li>Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates, arranging them nicely on the plate. Garnish with the orange zest and fennel pollen.</li>
        </ol>
