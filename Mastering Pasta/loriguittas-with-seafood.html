            <p>The island of Sardinia is home to dozens of unique handmade pastas with interesting shapes. This one comes from the town of Morgongiori and resembles a small rope shaped into a ring (loriga in Sardinian). It's usually served with simple tomato sauce or with a tomato and chicken ragù, but because the island is surrounded by such amazing seafood, I decided to serve it with scallops, squid, and uni. You can use whatever seafood is freshest (about 1½ pounds/680 grams total). You'll need a fine-mesh screen to dry the lorighittas. Any clean screen will do, or you can buy a pasta drying screen just for this purpose (see Sources, page 249).</p>

            <strong>Pasta Swap:</strong> Handmade farfalle would work, but this pasta is really about the shape of the lorighittas.
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (227 g) Lorighittas Semolina Dough (page 121)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 baby squid (about 12 oz/340 g), cleaned and finely diced, or 1 pound (454 g) cuttlefish, cleaned and finely julienned</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (237 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¾ cup (126 g) finely diced yellow onion</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 sea scallops (about 4 oz/57 g), preferably unsoaked diver scallops, finely diced</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">16 pieces cleaned uni (about 10 oz/283 g or ¾ cup)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2½ tablespoons (37 ml) fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2½ tablespoons (10 g) chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">To make the lorighittas completely by hand, divide the dough into a few pieces, roll the pieces on a long floured work surface into ropes about 1/4 inch in diameter, and then cut the ropes every 9 inches (23 cm) or so to make spaghetti. Or, to save time, fit your pasta extruder or stand-mixer attachment with the spaghetti plate. Set the extruder to medium speed; if using a stand-mixer attachment, feed the dough into the extruder in marble-size clumps, using a pushing tool to push the clumps through the extruder. The first few clumps may come out uneven; just throw them away. Continue gradually dropping marble-size clumps into the extruder and pushing them through, being careful not to overload it. As the pasta is extruded, cut it into 9-inch (23 cm) lengths and immediately dust it with flour to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">To form each lorighitta (see photos, page 180), flour your hands. Loosely wrap a piece of spaghetti twice around two fingers. The ends of the spaghetti should meet and there should be two rounds of spaghetti around your fingers. Now, remove your two fingers and pinch the two ends together. Gently roll the double rounds of spaghetti together between your fingertips to create a rope shape reminiscent of laid, or twisted, rope; the finished pasta should look like the loop of a noose, with no extra rope. Lay the lorighitta on a fine-mesh screen and repeat with the remaining dough. Dust the lorighittas with flour and let them dry at room temperature (65°F to 75°F/18°C to 24°C) for at least 1 day or up to 2 days.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">To clean each squid, pull away the head and tentacles from the hood (tube-like body), and then reach into the hood and pull out the entrails and the plastic-like quill, taking care not to puncture the pearly ink sac. Cut off the tentacles just above the eyes, and discard the head. Squeeze the base of the tentacles to force out the hard "beak," and rinse the tentacles and the hood under cold running water. Using the back of a paring knife or your fingers, pull and scrape off the gray membrane from the hood. Cut off and discard the 2 small wings on either side of the hoods. Chill the hoods and tentacles in ice water until ready to use. Then drain the squid, pat dry, and dice.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">If you don't have squid, you can use cuttlefish. The cleaning is similar. Grab the hard cuttlebone through the skin of the body and twist the bone to extract it through the skin. If the skin is tough, use a paring knife to make a small incision near the end of the body through which to extract the bone. Discard the bone. Work near a bowl of water so you can reserve the ink sacs. The ink sacs and entrails rest under the oval-shaped membrane you have just exposed. Work your fingers around the circumference of the oval-shaped membrane to separate the entire membrane (and the head and tentacles) from the rest of the body, taking care not to puncture the ink sacs inside. Squeeze the ink sacs into the bowl of water and reserve for another use (such as the risotto on page 234). Rinse the body under cold running water. Using the back of a paring knife or your fingers, pull and scrape off the dark membrane from the body. Finely julienne the body from top to bottom and set aside.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the lorighittas and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 10 to 12 minutes for 1-day-old pasta, 15 to 18 minutes for 2-day-old pasta.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onion and sweat it until it is soft but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the pasta by transferring it to the pan. Reserve the pasta water. Add the squid, scallops, uni, lemon juice, and parsley to the pan. Toss until the liquid reduces slightly, gets somewhat creamy, and coats the pasta, 2 to 3 minutes, adding a little pasta water if necessary to create a creamy sauce. The seafood should be lightly cooked and no longer translucent. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates.</li>
        </ol>
