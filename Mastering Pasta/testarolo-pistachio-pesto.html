        <p itemprop="description">Unlike other pastas, this one starts with a loose batter and is cooked like a crepe. The pancake gets deep brown and crisp on one side and is riddled with holes on the other. It is then cut into diamond shapes, put briefly into hot water, and then tossed with a smooth sauce. The dish originates in the Lunigiana, historical area that falls in both Tuscany and Liguria. The locals once cooked the crepes in glazed terra-cotta dishes (a testo in Italian) but now use giant cast-iron pans over a blazing-hot wood fire. I've tried it both ways and, whether you heat a cast-iron pan on the stove top or a terra-cotta dish in a hot oven, both work well.</p>

    <div class="ingredients">
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3½ cups Testarolo Batter (page 177)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (150 g) shelled and peeled pistachios, preferably Sicilian</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (118 ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons (28 g) pine nuts</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon (6 g) grated orange zest</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (57 g) soft fresh goat cheese, crumbled</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat a 10- or 12-inch (25 or 30 cm) round, heavy skillet (such as cast iron) over high heat. Let the skillet heat up until it is blisteringly hot, at least 15 minutes or up to 30 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">When the pan is ready, measure about ¾ cup (177 ml) of the batter for a 10-inch (25 cm) pan or 1 cup (237 ml) of the batter for a 12-inch (30 cm) pan. Pour the batter into the hot pan, starting at the perimeter of the pan and moving gradually inward in a circular motion so the batter completely covers the pan bottom in an even layer. The batter should immediately blister and form bubble holes. Cook uncovered for 30 seconds. Then, turn down the heat to medium and cover the pan to partially steam the testarolo. Cook until the bottom is deeply browned and the testarolo starts to puff up and release itself from the pan, about 1½ minutes more. Scrape the testarolo out of the pan like a crepe and transfer it to a cooling rack.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Repeat with the remaining batter, letting the pan reheat over high heat for at least 5 minutes between each testarolo. You should have 4 testaroli, and you might have a little left over, depending on the size of your pan. When each testarolo is cool, cut it into 8 diamond shapes. The easy way to do this is to first cut the circle into eighths as if you are cutting a pizza. Then go around the outside of the circle and cut diamond shapes by notching out 8 triangles from the perimeter. Snack on those triangles or serve them separately. Alternatively, you can cut the circle into strips 2 inches (5 cm) wide, then cut the strips crosswise on an angle to create diamond shapes (lozenges). Use the pieces within 1 hour or freeze them in a single layer on a floured rimmed baking sheet, transfer them to a zipper-lock plastic bag, and freeze them for up to 1 month.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Grind the pistachios and oil in a food processor until the nuts are very finely chopped but not completely pureed, 1 to 2 minutes. Taste the mixture, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. You should have about 1 cup (237 ml).</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the testarolo pieces and cook them for 15 seconds, just to reheat and slightly hydrate them. Avoid overcooking them or they will turn to mush.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, toast the pine nuts in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat, shaking the pan now and then, until they are lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the pine nuts to a plate. Pour the pistachio pesto into the pan and gently heat it over medium heat. Using tongs, a spider strainer, or a slotted spoon, drain the testarolo pieces by transferring them to the pan of pesto. Toss them gently until well coated, 1 minute.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the testarolo pieces, browned side up, onto warmed plates and arrange them in a star or other attractive pattern. Drizzle on some of the pesto, and then garnish with the pine nuts, orange zest, and goat cheese.</li>
