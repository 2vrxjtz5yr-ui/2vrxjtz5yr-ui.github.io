        <h1 itemprop="name">Baccalà Gnocchi with Squid</h1>
        
        <div class="recipe-meta">
            <span itemprop="recipeYield">Makes 6 to 8 servings (about 200 gnocchi)</span>
        </div>

        <div class="description" itemprop="description">
            <p>To give potato gnocchi a kick in the pants, I like to add baccalà, or salt cod. It gives the dumplings a light, flaky texture and a shot of briny flavor. If you can't find squid, you can use sea scallops instead. Cut the scallops into coins about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick, and then cut the coins into strips.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces (114 g) baccalà (salt cod) fillet</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ pounds (680 g) russet potatoes (about 2)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¾ cup (25 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 lemon</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (76 g) tipo 00 flour, or ½ cup plus 2 tablespoons (76 g) all-purpose flour, plus some for dusting</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 pounds (907 g) baby squid, cleaned</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (60 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon (3 g) finely chopped fresh chives</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">To remove the excess salt from the baccalà, soak the fillet in water to cover in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days, changing the soaking water two or three times each day. Drain the baccalà, remove any skin, and then finely chop it. Set aside.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Combine the potatoes (unpeeled) and salted water to cover by 1 inch (2.5 cm) in a saucepan. Cover, bring the water to a boil over high heat, and boil until a knife slides easily in and out of the potatoes, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the pan from the heat and transfer the potatoes to a cutting board. Immediately peel off and discard the skins. Wear gloves if the potatoes feel too hot to handle. Coarsely chop the potatoes, and then pass them through a potato ricer or a food mill fitted with the fine die onto a large, lightly floured cutting board or smooth work surface, covering the floured cutting board or smooth work surface with the potatoes. (Spreading out the potatoes helps to evaporate excess moisture.) Let the potatoes stand for 5 minutes, and then sprinkle the Parmesan evenly over the potatoes. Weigh out 2 ounces (57 g/about ⅓ cup) of the baccalà and sprinkle it evenly over the top. Using a Microplane or other fine-rasp grater, grate the zest from the lemon over the baccalà. (Reserve the lemon for use later.) Scatter the flour evenly over the top and season with about ½ teaspoon (1.5 g) salt and ¼ teaspoon (0.5 g) pepper. Finally, pour the egg evenly over the top. Using a bench scraper, cut the layered ingredients into the potatoes, repeatedly scraping, cutting, and mixing until the dough comes together.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Gently knead the dough just until it has a uniform consistency, about 1 minute. Be careful not to overwork the dough or it will develop excess gluten, which will make the gnocchi tough. Shape the dough into a rectangular block, then flour the bench scraper or a knife and cut the block in half to make two 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide from the block. Roll each slab on the floured surface into a rope about ½ inch (12 mm) in diameter. Using the floured bench scraper or knife, cut the rope crosswise into ½-inch (12 mm) pieces. Gently roll a cut side of each piece on a lightly floured grooved gnocchi board (or use a clean comb or the tines of a fork) to roll in the notch on the exterior and create an oval shape. As the gnocchi are formed, transfer them to a generously floured rimmed baking sheet and shake the baking sheet to dust the gnocchi with the flour. You should have about 200 gnocchi.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Use the gnocchi within 1 hour or cover them loosely and refrigerate them for up to 8 hours. You can also freeze them in a single layer, transfer them to a zipper-lock bag, and freeze them for up to 2 weeks. Take the gnocchi straight from the freezer to the boiling water, adding 30 seconds or so to the cooking time.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">To clean each squid, pull away the head and tentacles from the hood (tube-like body), and then reach into the hood and pull out the entrails and the plastic-like quill, taking care not to puncture the pearly ink sac. Cut off the tentacles just above the eyes, and discard the head. Squeeze the base of the tentacles to force out the hard "beak," and rinse the tentacles and the hood under cold running water. Using the back of a paring knife or your fingers, pull and scrape off the gray membrane from the hood. Cut off and discard the 2 small wings on either side of the hoods. Chill the hoods and tentacles in ice water until ready to use. Then drain the squid, pat dry, and dice.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Have ready a bowl of ice water. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop the gnocchi into the boiling water and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a low boil. Adjust the heat so that the water simmers, stirring gently. Cook the gnocchi until springy to the touch and tender throughout, 3 to 5 minutes. Squeeze a dumpling between your fingers. It should have some bounce-back. If it just flattens, the gnocchi are not done yet. Using a spider strainer, immediately transfer the gnocchi to the ice water and let them sit in the water for 30 seconds to stop the cooking. Transfer the gnocchi to dry kitchen towels and pat them dry. Reserve the gnocchi water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cut the squid hoods crosswise into slices ¼ inch (6 mm) wide, and cut the tentacles in half. Pour gnocchi water to a depth of ⅛ to ¼ inch (3 to 6 mm) into a large, deep sauté pan and place over medium heat. Add the remaining 2 ounces (57 g/about ⅓ cup) chopped baccalà and the squid tentacles and cook until the tentacles are half-cooked, about 1 minute. Cut the reserved lemon in half and squeeze the juice (without seeds) into the pan. Add the squid hoods, gnocchi, oil, and chives. Shake the pan until the sauce thickens slightly and the squid tubes just begin to turn opaque, about 30 seconds.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the gnocchi and squid onto warmed plates.</li>
        </ol>
