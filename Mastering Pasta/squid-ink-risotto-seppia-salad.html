            <p>I learned this dish at Taverna Colleoni dell'Angelo in Bergamo's old city. It was one of the restaurant's old-school specialties. The texture of the ricotta pairs perfectly with the cuttlefish, or seppia in Italian, and a touch of red pepper flakes heats things up while the ricotta cools them down. If you can't find cuttlefish, use squid and julienne both the bodies and tentacles.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 pounds (907 g) cuttlefish, (about 1½ pounds/680 g cleaned; see page 180)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tablespoons (60 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (56 g) chopped yellow onion</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (60 ml) dry white wine</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 teaspoons (10 ml) fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon (4 g) chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (227 g) ricotta impastata cheese (see page 241)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Pinch of red pepper flakes, plus some for garnish</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (195 g) Carnaroli rice</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon (5 ml) squid ink</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 to 7 cups (1.4 to 1.7 L) boiling water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Reserve the ink sacs from the cuttlefish. Finely julienne the cuttlefish bodies.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the oil in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onion and sweat it until it is soft but not browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the cuttlefish and sweat for 2 minutes. Add the wine and cook for 5 minutes. The cuttlefish will start to give up its liquid. If necessary, add just enough water to barely cover the cuttlefish, and then cover and braise it over low heat for 22 minutes. Drain off any excess liquid, and then stir in 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the oil, the lemon juice, and the parsley. Taste the salad, adding salt, pepper, and additional lemon juice and oil until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Puree the ricotta in a blender or food processor until supersmooth, 2 to 3 minutes, scraping down the sides a few times. Add the pepper flakes and season the mixture with salt and pepper. Puree the ricotta again, and then taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 ml) oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the rice and sauté the rice until it is translucent around the edges and starts to brown a little, 2 to 3 minutes. This is an important step to develop the right flavor and texture in the rice; make sure the rice absorbs some of the oil.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the squid ink to the boiling water and squeeze the cuttlefish ink sacs into the water, extracting their ink. Gradually add 6½ cups (1.5 L) of the inky water about ½ cup (118 ml) at a time, stirring almost constantly over medium-high heat until the rice absorbs the water after each addition. When the rice is done, it should be tender but still a little chewy when bitten and have released most of its starch, creating a creamy sauce in the pan. This process will take 25 to 30 minutes. Near the end of cooking, add a little more salt, if necessary, and stir the rice like crazy to release as much starch as possible and create the sauce. Drag your spoon through the rice to the bottom of the pan; the sauce should slowly fill in the line you made. Taste the risotto, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the risotto onto warmed plates and spoon the pureed ricotta over the risotto. Spoon the cuttlefish salad on top and garnish with red pepper flakes.</li>
        </ol>
