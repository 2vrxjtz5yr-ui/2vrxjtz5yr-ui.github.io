            <p>Here's a simple, round ricotta ravioli you can make from start to finish in less than an hour. I like to roll this dough the old-school way: by hand into a circle or square rather than into sheets with a machine roller. Either way, keep this ravioli out of the freezer. If you freeze a plain ricotta filling, it will get grainy. To keep it creamy, use the ravioli right after you make them. You could also refrigerate them for up to a day.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Dough Swap:</strong> I like the chew of this stone-ground wheat dough against the creaminess of the ricotta, but if you want a richer mouthfeel, use Egg Yolk Dough (page 26).
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups (1 lb/454 g) ricotta impastata cheese (see page 241)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon (3 g) kosher salt</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ teaspoon (1 g) freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">⅛ teaspoon (0.3 g) freshly ground black pepper, plus some for garnish</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (227 g) Whole Egg, Bread Flour, and Stone-Ground Wheat Dough (page 29)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (114 g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (50 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a bowl, mix together the ricotta, salt, nutmeg, pepper, and egg with a spoon.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cut the dough in half and lay it on a lightly floured work surface. Roll out half of the dough into an 18-inch (45 cm) square between ⅛ inch (1.5 mm) and 1⁄16 inch (0.8 mm) thick. Starting about 2 inches (5 cm) from the edge of the dough, drop 1¾-inch (4.5 cm) balls of filling (about 1½ tablespoons/21 g) in a row that goes from one edge of the square to the opposite edge, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) between the balls. Lightly mist the dough with water to help create a good seal. Fold the 2-inch (5 cm) edge of dough over the filling. Using the round cutter 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter, punch out ravioli along the row, in rows, folding the dough over the filling, and punching out the ravioli. Repeat with the remaining pasta sheets and filling. As the ravioli are formed, transfer them to floured rimmed baking sheets. You should have about 24 ravioli. Cover the ravioli and use them within 1 hour or refrigerate them for up to 8 hours. Avoid freezing the ravioli because the ricotta filling will become grainy.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the ravioli and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a low boil. Gently cook the ravioli until they are tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 3 to 5 minutes. The filling should look smooth and creamy; if it is grainy, the ravioli are overcooked. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the ravioli, letting them drip-dry for a moment. Arrange the ravioli on warmed plates and drizzle on the melted butter. Sprinkle with some Parmesan and a few grinds of pepper.</li>
