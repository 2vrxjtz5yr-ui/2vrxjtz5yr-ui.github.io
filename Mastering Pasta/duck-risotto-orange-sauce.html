            <p>Here's a play on the classic French duck à l'orange. The flavors work perfectly, so why not make risotto with them? More importantly, this recipe shows you how to make risotto a few hours ahead of time. You parcook the rice in the oven, then finish it later on the stove top. The duck ragù and orange sauce can also be made hours or even a day or two ahead, so when it comes time to serve, the whole dish comes together quickly.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 duck (4 to 5 lb/1.8 to 2.3 kg)</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tablespoons (60 ml) grapeseed or canola oil</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (168 g) finely chopped yellow onion</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (61 g) peeled and chopped carrot</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (51 g) chopped celery</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (21 g) dried porcini mushrooms</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1¼ cups (315 ml) dry white wine</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">7 cups (1.7 L) duck stock (page 242), plus more if needed</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (237 ml) fresh orange juice</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (195 g) Carnaroli rice</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 fresh basil leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">To make the duck ragù, heat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Remove the giblets from the duck and reserve them for another use. Trim any excess fat from the duck. Cut the leg-thigh portions from the body by pulling each leg away from the body, bending the leg to find the hip joint, and then driving your knife straight through the joint. Remove the breasts by cutting slits on either side of the breastbone, and then working the knife carefully around the rib cage, keeping the knife against bone at all times and pulling the breast meat from the carcass. Reserve the legs and carcass to make duck stock. Separate the legs from the thighs by driving a cleaver straight through the joint.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Season the duck pieces all over with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the duck pieces, skin side down in a single layer, and sear them, turning them only once, until most of the fat is rendered out and the skin is deeply browned all over, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Transfer the pieces to a plate.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Drain off all but 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the fat from the pan (strain and render the fat for another purpose; it will keep frozen for 8 to 10 months—duck fat is great for frying potatoes) and return the pan to medium heat. Add ¼ cup (126 g) of the onion, the carrot, and the celery to the pan and sweat the vegetables until they are soft but not browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the porcini, and then deglaze the pan with 1 cup (237 ml) of the wine, scraping up any browned bits from the pan bottom. Return the duck and any accumulated juices to the pan, and then add water to come about three-fourths of the way up the sides of the duck pieces. Cover and braise the duck in the oven until the meat is very tender, 2 to 3 hours.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the pan from the oven and let the duck cool in the pan. When it is cool enough to handle, pick and shred the meat from the bones, discarding the fat and skin; reserve the bones to make duck stock. Skim any excess fat from the surface of the braising liquid, then pass the braising liquid and vegetables through a food mill fitted with the large die, or pulse them briefly in a food processor just until the vegetables are finely chopped but not completely pureed. If the ragù is watery, return it to the pan and boil it over medium heat until slightly thickened, then mix the shredded meat into the ragù. Taste the ragù, adding salt and pepper to taste, then cool to 70°F (21°C). You should have about 3½ cups (828 ml) meaty ragù. Use it within 2 hours or refrigerate it in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">To make the orange sauce, pour 2 cups (473 ml) of the stock into a saucepan, bring to a boil over high heat, and boil until reduced by about half, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the orange juice and boil again until the liquid is reduced by about half (to about 1 cup/237 ml), 10 to 15 minutes. Taste the sauce, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Use the sauce within 2 hours or refrigerate it in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons (30 ml) oil in an ovenproof saucepan over medium heat. Add the remaining ¾ cup (42 g) onion and sweat it until it is soft but not browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the rice and sauté the rice until it is translucent around the edges and starts to brown a little, 2 to 3 minutes. This is an important step to develop the right flavor and texture in the rice; make sure the rice absorbs some of the oil. Pour in the remaining ⅓ cup (78 ml) wine and simmer it until the pan goes dry, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Stir in 2 cups (473 ml) of the stock, bring it to a boil over high heat, and then cover the pan and set it in the oven for 6 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and let it stand, covered, for up to 2 hours, stirring every 15 minutes or so to release some steam.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">When you are ready to serve the dish, bring the remaining 3 cups (710 ml) stock to a boil in a small saucepan. Put the risotto pan over medium-high heat. Add the boiling stock to the risotto 1 cup (237 ml) at a time, stirring constantly until the rice absorbs the stock after each addition. Stir vigorously to release the starch in the rice. When the rice is done, it should be tender but still a little chewy and have released most of its starch, creating a creamy sauce in the pan. This process will take 10 to 15 minutes (about half the time of risotto cooked completely on the stove top). Near the end of cooking, add a little more boiling stock if necessary and stir the rice like crazy to release as much starch as possible and create the sauce. Drag your spoon through the rice; the line the bottom of the pan; the sauce should slowly fill in the line you made. Stir in 2 cups (473 ml) of the duck ragù; reserve any remaining ragù for another use. Taste the risotto, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">If the orange sauce has been refrigerated, reheat it in a saucepan over medium heat. Stack the basil leaves, roll them up lengthwise, and then cut crosswise into thin slices (chiffonade).</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the risotto onto warmed plates and spoon some of the warm orange sauce over each serving. Garnish with the basil.</li>
