            <p>Most people think snails are a French thing, but they're also a big part of Italian cuisine. I love them with Chianti, mushrooms, and pasta. If you can't get fresh snails, the canned ones from Potironne are excellent (see Sources, page 249). We actually buy the pasta for this dish, too. It's one of Setaro's unique pastas made with porcini powder and extruded to resemble porcini mushrooms (see Sources). There's no shame in buying good factory-made pasta. Italians do it all the time!</p>

            <strong>PASTA SWAP:</strong> Chestnut Dough (page 145) cut into fettuccine would be really good with this. Red Wine Semolina Dough (page 121) extruded into spaghetti would be great, too.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2½ cups (112 g) dried porcini mushrooms</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups (710 ml) boiling water</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (114 g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small red onion, minced</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 small cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¾ cup (177 ml) Chianti</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (7 oz/200 g) canned Burgundy snails</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces (340 g) good-quality store-bought porcini pasta</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (30 ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (25 g) grated Parmesan cheese, plus some for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place the mushrooms in a heatproof bowl and pour in the boiling water. Let the mushrooms soak for 10 to 15 minutes to rehydrate them. Pluck out the porcini, taking care not to disturb the sediment at the bottom of the bowl, and chop them if large, preferably into strips that resemble shredded meat. Strain the soaking liquid through a cheesecloth or a clean coffee filter and reserve it for the ragù.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Melt 4 tablespoons (57 g) of the butter in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and sweat them until they are soft but not browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour in the wine, raise the heat to medium-high, and cook until the wine nearly evaporates. Add the mushrooms and their soaking water and simmer the mixture until it thickens a little, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the snails and simmer for 5 minutes. Taste the ragù, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the pasta and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 8 to 10 minutes. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the pasta by transferring it to the pan of sauce. Reserve the pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the remaining 4 tablespoons (57 g) butter and the olive oil to the pan. Toss over medium heat until the sauce gets creamy and coats the pasta, 1 to 2 minutes, adding a little pasta water if necessary to create a creamy sauce. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the Parmesan. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, add salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates and garnish with the remaining Parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
