            <p>Giuliano Bugialli used to live just around the corner from Vetri in Philadelphia. If you don't know who Bugialli is, he ranks up there with Marcella Hazan as one of the all-time great champions of classic Italian cooking. When he finally came in for a meal at the restaurant, a story that I recount on page 49, this was his favorite dish. In Rome, the traditional way to serve artichokes is braised with mint (the dish is called carciofi alla romana). It's the same combination here, but we stuff the artichokes into cannelloni and serve them with a fresh mint salad. The recipe makes modest portions, so it's perfect as a first course.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 quarts (3 L) water</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (30 ml) fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">14 baby artichokes</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 tablespoons (90 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (42 g) finely chopped red onion</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (28 g) ricotta impastata cheese (see page 241)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (227 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into sheets a little less than 1⁄16 inch (3 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups (473 ml) béchamel (page 245), refrigerated</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 fresh mint leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Combine the water and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the lemon juice in a bowl. Working with 1 artichoke at a time, snap off and discard the tough, dark green leaves until you are left with only yellow and light green leaves. Cut off the tough top of each artichoke (about ⅓ inch/12 mm). Trim the dark green parts from the bottom of the artichoke until only white and light green are visible. It will seem like barely any artichoke is left, but you will have reduced it down to the best part for eating. Cut the artichoke in half lengthwise. As each artichoke is trimmed and halved, drop it into the lemon water to keep it from browning.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of the oil in a large, deep sauté pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Remove the artichokes from the water and pat dry. When the oil is hot, add the artichokes, cut side down, and cook until they are golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the onion and cook, shaking the pan now and then, until the onion is lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Add enough water to cover the pan bottom (about ½ cup/60 ml) and bring the liquid to a simmer. Turn down the heat to low, cover the pan, and braise the artichokes until they are tender and the pan bottom is nearly dry, about 20 minutes, adding as little water as necessary to keep the artichokes from scorching.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer the artichokes and onion to a cutting board, let them cool until they can be handled, and then finely chop them. Save a few small spoonfuls of artichokes for garnish, if you like. Transfer the rest of the artichokes and onion to a bowl and stir in the ricotta. Taste the filling, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Spoon the filling into a zipper-lock bag and seal closed, then snip a corner from the bag and pipe about one-fourth (about 1 cup/237 ml) of the filling into a 2½- to 3-quart (2.5 to 3 L) baking dish or 6 individual baking dishes, spreading it to create a thin layer on the bottom of the dish(es).</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and cut it into 4-inch (10 cm) squares. Repeat with the remaining sheets. You should get 8 to 10 squares from each sheet, or 16 to 20 total. As you work, lightly mist the pasta with water to keep it from drying out. The pieces will be delicate and some may stick, but you should have plenty.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches to prevent crowding, drop in the pasta and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Blanch the pasta for 15 to 20 seconds, stirring gently to prevent sticking. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, transfer the pasta squares to kitchen towels or paper towels, laying them flat and patting them dry. They will be delicate and some may stick, but you should have plenty.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oven to 500°F (260°C). Turn on the convection, if possible. Spoon the refrigerated béchamel into a zipper-lock bag and seal closed, then snip a corner from the bag and pipe some of the béchamel into a 2½- to 3-quart (2.5 to 3 L) baking dish or 6 individual baking dishes, spreading it to create a thin layer on the bottom of the dish(es).</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Snip a corner from the artichoke bag and pipe a line of the filling ¾ inch (2 cm) thick along one edge of each pasta square. Starting at the filled side, use the edge of the towel to lift and tightly roll the pasta to enclose the filling. Transfer the cannelloni, seam side down, to the baking dish(es). Pipe a line of béchamel 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide onto each cannelloni.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bake the cannelloni until the béchamel begins to melt and lightly brown on top, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, place the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 ml) lemon juice in a small bowl and slowly whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons (30 ml) oil. Chop the mint, or, for a more elegant look, stack the mint leaves into 2 or 3 stacks, roll up each stack lengthwise, and cut crosswise into very thin slices (chiffonade). Add the mint to the bowl and toss gently to mix everything together. Taste the mixture, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer 2 or 3 cannelloni to each warmed plate if baked in a single dish, or leave in the individual dishes. Top each serving with some of the mint salad and the reserved artichokes, if you have reserved some.</li>
