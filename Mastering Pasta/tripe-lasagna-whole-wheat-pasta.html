            <p>I've always been adamant that tripe should taste like tripe and not like water. Everyone boils and boils it, removing all of the flavor. But tripe has great flavor. It just needs to be subtle and balanced. If you've never had tripe, this dish is a great introduction.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1¼ pounds (567 g) honeycomb tripe</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (60 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (84 g) finely chopped yellow onion</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (51 g) finely chopped celery</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (70 g) peeled and finely chopped carrot</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 large whole canned San Marzano tomatoes</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cups (946 ml) whole milk</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1¾ pounds (794 g) Whole Egg and Whole Wheat Dough (page 29), rolled into sheets a little less than ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 cups (946 ml) béchamel (page 245), warmed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">To cook the tripe, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the tripe and boil, uncovered, at a steady boil for 1½ hours. Remove the tripe and let the tripe cool in the liquid. When the tripe is cool enough to handle, remove it from the liquid and slice it into pieces ½ inch (12 mm) wide. Discard the liquid and set the tripe aside.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, and carrot and sweat the vegetables until they are tender but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, crushing them with your hand as you add them to the pan. Cook the mixture until the tomatoes begin to break down, 6 to 8 minutes. Pour in the milk, raise the heat to high, and bring the mixture to a boil. Add the tripe, turn down the heat to low, cover, and braise the tripe, stirring now and then, until it is tender and the liquid reduces in volume slightly, about 2 hours. When the mixture is done, it should have the consistency of a ragù. At that point, remove the pan from the heat and stir in ¾ cup (75 g) of the Parmesan. Taste the ragù, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Let cool until warm and slightly thickened.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the edges square. You will be cutting them for a 13 by 9-inch (33 by 23 cm) pan. If you have a different-size pan, cut the pasta to fit the pan. Cut the first pasta sheet into a piece about 30 inches (76 cm) long and 3½ to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) wide. Cut a second pasta sheet to the same dimensions. Cut the remaining pasta sheets to pieces about 14 inches (35.5 cm) long and 4 inches (10 cm) wide. You should have 6 pieces total. As you work, lightly mist the pasta with water and cover with clean kitchen towels to keep it from drying out.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Have ready a large bowl of ice water. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches to prevent crowding, drop in the pasta and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Blanch the pasta for 30 seconds. Using tongs or a spider strainer, transfer each piece to the ice water for about 30 seconds to stop the cooking, then lay the pieces flat on kitchen towels or paper towels and pat them dry.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Generously butter a 13 by 9-inch (33 by 23 cm) baking dish. Arrange the two 30-inch (76 cm) lengths of pasta lengthwise and side by side in the prepared baking dish, letting the extra length hang over one edge of the dish. Spoon about 1 cup (237 ml) of the ragù over the pasta, and then spoon about the same amount of béchamel over the ragù. Sprinkle with ¼ cup (25 g) of the Parmesan. Top with a layer of two 14-inch (35.5 cm) lengths of pasta, followed by a layer of ragù, a layer of béchamel, and a layer of Parmesan in the same amounts as the first layers. Repeat with another layer of 14-inch (35.5 cm) lengths of pasta, ragù, béchamel, and Parmesan. Fold the overhanging pasta over the top and tuck the ends of those lengths over the other ends in the dish to seal the lasagna like a package. Top with a final layer of ragù, béchamel, and Parmesan, again in the same amounts as the first layers.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bake the lasagna until it is golden brown on top, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove it from the oven and let it stand for 15 to 20 minutes, then cut it into squares or rectangles. You can also let the whole pan of lasagna cool down, cover it, and refrigerate it for up to 2 days, and then blast each serving of lasagna in a hot oven (500°F/260°C) until warmed through.</li>
