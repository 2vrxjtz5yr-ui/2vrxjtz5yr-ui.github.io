        <p itemprop="description">Always made by hand, strozzapreti (priest stranglers) are little strips of dough rolled between your palms. Each strip has a groove along its length that helps the pasta hold onto the sauce. Meaty green tomatoes bring the perfect texture and acidity to this recipe. If you use sweeter red tomatoes, add a little lemon juice to replicate that acid. And if you don't have razor clams, use another shellfish, like oysters, for a similar effect.</p>

        <strong>PASTA SWAP:</strong> I've made this dish with bucatini, spaghetti, and chitarra and all three work great.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (227 g) Pici Dough (page 175) or Culurgione Dough (page 29), rolled into sheets between ⅛ inch and ⅛ inch (3 mm and 1.5 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 large green tomatoes</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 tablespoons (90 ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus some for drizzling</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small clove garlic, smashed</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 razor clams</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (16 g) chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a floured work surface and cut it into strips ½ inch (1 cm) by 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) wide. To form each strozzapreto, rest a strip in your palms and roll it between your palms to create a rough shape resembling a drill bit. Pinch off the spiraled portion in 2½- to 3-inch (6 to 7.5 cm) lengths and place them on a floured rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. You should have about 75 pieces. Dust them with flour, cover loosely, and use within 4 hours or refrigerate for up to 8 hours. You can also freeze them in a single layer, transfer to a zipper-lock bag, and freeze for up to 1 month. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Have ready a bowl of ice water. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Using a small, sharp knife, score an X on the bottom of each tomato, then drop the tomatoes into the boiling water and blanch them until the skins begin to split and curl back from the X, 30 to 60 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the tomatoes to the ice water and let cool a minute or two. Starting at the X, peel the skin from each tomato and discard it. Dice the tomatoes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat ½ cup (60 ml) of the oil in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. Add the shallot and garlic and sweat them until they are soft but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and discard the garlic. Add the diced tomatoes and cook them, stirring now and then to keep them from browning, until they are soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn down the heat to low and keep the sauce warm.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, shuck the razor clams and remove the meats from the shells. Rinse the clams and cut them into small pieces the size of coffee beans. Toss the clams with the remaining 2 tablespoons (30 ml) oil and season them with salt.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the strozzapreti and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the pasta by transferring it to the sauce. Reserve the pasta water. Add the clam mixture, parsley, and 1 cup (240 ml) of the pasta water and toss over medium-high heat until the sauce reduces slightly, gets creamy, and coats the pasta, 2 to 3 minutes. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates.</li>
