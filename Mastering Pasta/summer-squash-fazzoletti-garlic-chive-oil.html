            <p>Baked fazzoletti are almost like ravioli. You cut big squares of fresh pasta—about 5 inches (12 cm) square—spread some filling on each square, fold it over into a triangle, fill it again, and fold it one more time into a smaller triangle. Then you brown the triangles in the oven and end up with crispy pasta edges with a creamy center. I just love that contrast. If you can't find stracciatella cheese for this dish, puree 12 ounces (340 g) burrata in a blender or food processor. Or just use the center cream in burrata; it's basically the same thing as stracciatella. In some ways, the garlic chive oil is the star here. The dish is okay without it, but that final touch makes a huge difference. You will not need all of the oil for this dish. Use the remainder as a dip for bread or drizzle it on eggs, fish, or vegetables.</p>

        <h2>Garlic Chive Oil</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ bunch garlic chives, about ½ cup packed (24 g)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ bunch chives, about ½ cup packed (24 g)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (237 ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Squash Fazzoletti</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ cups (12 oz/340 g) ricotta impastata cheese (see page 241)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces (340 g) stracciatella cheese</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (30 ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 yellow summer squashes (about 6 oz/170 g each), trimmed and julienned</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 zucchini (about 6 oz /170 g each), trimmed and julienned</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 sprigs thyme</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces (340 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into sheets about 1⁄16 inch (1.5 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ cups (150 g) grated Parmesan cheese, plus some for garnish</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ cups (355 ml) béchamel (page 245), warmed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">To make the garlic chive oil, combine all of the ingredients in a blender and blend until the mixture is as smooth as possible, 2 to 3 minutes (there will still be flecks of chives). Use it immediately or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">To make the fazzoletti, stir together the ricotta and stracciatella in a bowl. Taste the mixture, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oil in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the squashes, zucchini, garlic, and thyme and sweat the squashes until they are soft and pliable but not browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and taste the mixture, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Let the mixture cool in the pan.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the edges square. Cut the pasta into 5-inch (12 cm) squares. Repeat with the remaining sheets. You should get 6 squares from each sheet or 18 total. Use them immediately, or freeze them in a single layer, transfer them to a zipper-lock bag, and freeze them for up to 1 month. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oven to 475°F (245°C). Turn on the convection, if possible. Generously butter 2 rimmed baking sheets or six 2-cup (473 ml) individual baking dishes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Have ready a large bowl of ice water. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches to prevent crowding, drop in the pasta squares and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Blanch the pasta for 15 to 20 seconds, stirring gently to prevent sticking. Using a spider strainer or tongs, immediately transfer the pasta squares to the ice water to stop the cooking. Lay the squares flat on clean kitchen towels or paper towels and pat them dry.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place equal amounts of the squash and ricotta mixtures in the middle of a square (about 3 tablespoons/43 g total), leaving the garlic and thyme in the pan. Top with 1 teaspoon (2 g) Parmesan. Fold the square in half over the filling to form a triangle, gently spreading out the filling to make the pasta as flat as possible. Repeat the step with more squash and cheeses, placing them in the center of the triangle, and fold the triangle in half again to form a smaller triangle; leave the pasta a little lumpier in the center like ravioli. Repeat with the remaining pasta squares and filling. Place the fazzoletti on the prepared baking sheets or in the prepared baking dishes, allowing 3 fazzoletti per serving and leaving a little room between them. Spread a scant tablespoon (15 ml) of béchamel over the entire surface of each fazzoletto, and then sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bake the fazzoletti until bubbly and lightly browned on top, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Divide the fazzoletti among warmed plates if baked on baking sheets, allowing 3 fazzoletti per serving, or leave in the individual baking dishes. Top each serving with a drizzle of the garlic chive oil and garnish with Parmesan.</li>
