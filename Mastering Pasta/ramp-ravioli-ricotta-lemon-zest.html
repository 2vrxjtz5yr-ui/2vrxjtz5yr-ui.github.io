            <p>Ramp season only lasts for about a month in Pennsylvania, and this ravioli is what I look forward to most during that time. It's probably one of the best things that chef Brad Spence came up with during his tenure at Vetri. The ravioli are half-moons, and the ricotta is whipped and piped onto the plates under the ravioli. Brown butter and Parmesan go on top. Simple and perfect.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>DOUGH SWAP:</strong> The ramps need to shine here, but Chive Dough (page 145) or Parsley Dough (page 143) would complement them nicely.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ pounds (680 g) ramps, stems and greens separated</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons (45 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon (15 ml) grapeseed or canola oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (22 g) fresh bread crumbs (1 slice bread pulsed in a food processor)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (25 g) grated Parmesan cheese, plus some for garnish</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces (340 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into sheets about 1/32 inch (0.8 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (113 g) ricotta impastata cheese (see page 241)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 tablespoons (85 g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Grated zest of ½ lemon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Julienne enough of the ramp stems and greens to equal ½ cup (40 g) fine strips (about 1 head's/40 g worth). Heat 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium-low heat. Add the remaining ramp stems (but not the greens) and cook, stirring now and then, until the stems are very tender but not brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Scrape the ramp stems into a food processor.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the grapeseed oil to the pan and place over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the ramp greens and cook them just until they wilt, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape the greens into the food processor. Puree the ramps until they are relatively smooth, and then add the bread crumbs and Parmesan and process until blended. Taste the filling, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Add the egg and process until blended. Spoon the filling into a zipper-lock bag or pastry bag, seal closed, and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Snip a corner off the bag of filling and, starting at each of the long edges, pipe ½-inch (12 mm) balls of filling in two rows down the entire length of the sheet, leaving a 1½-inch (4 cm) margin around each ball of filling (3 inches/7.5 cm total between rows). Lightly mist the dough with water to keep it from drying out and to help create a good seal. Fold the long edge of the pasta closest to you over one row of filling. Fold the opposite long edge over the other row of filling. Use your fingers to press out the air around each ball of filling. Using a round cutter (preferably fluted) 2 to 2½ inches (5 to 6 cm) in diameter, cut out half-moons by positioning the cutter halfway over the filling. Repeat the process with the remaining pasta and filling. As the ravioli are formed, transfer them to floured rimmed baking sheets. You should have 50 to 60 ravioli.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cover the ravioli and use them within 1 hour or refrigerate them for up to 4 hours. You can also freeze the ravioli in a single layer, transfer them to zipper-lock bags, and freeze them for up to 2 weeks. Take the ravioli right from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Puree the ricotta and the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil in a small food processor until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Taste the mixture, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Spoon the whipped ricotta into a zipper-lock bag, seal closed, and refrigerate until needed.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Melt the butter in a sauté pan over medium heat and cook until it turns golden yellow and the milk solids fall to the bottom of the pan and turn golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the reserved julienned ramp stems and greens; they should frizzle up in 1 to 2 minutes. Keep warm over low heat.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches to prevent crowding, drop in the ravioli and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a low boil. Gently cook the ravioli until they are tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, pipe a thin stripe of whipped ricotta—about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide—down the center of 6 warmed pasta plates. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the ravioli, letting them drip-dry for a moment. Arrange the drained ravioli on the other side of each plate. Drizzle the ravioli with honey and sprinkle with the walnuts.</li>
