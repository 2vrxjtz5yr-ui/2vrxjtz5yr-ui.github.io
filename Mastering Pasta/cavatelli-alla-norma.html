            <p>One of Sicily's most famous dishes, pasta alla Norma comes from Catania and includes some of the region's signature ingredients: eggplant, tomato, basil, and ricotta salata. Supposedly, a local playwright named Nino Martoglio loved the dish so much that he compared it to Norma, the famous opera by Vincenzo Bellini. The name stuck.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound (454 g) Cavatelli Dough (page 176)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (237 ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ Spanish onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 pints (1.1 kg) grape tomatoes</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 cups (710 ml) grapeseed or canola oil, for frying</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ pounds (680 g) Japanese or other small eggplants (about 12 small eggplants), sliced into half-moons ¼ inch (6 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 red onions, halved and thinly sliced into half-moons</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 big, fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (8 g) chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ teaspoon (0.5 g) red pepper flakes</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (50 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 chunk ricotta salata cheese, for shaving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces and let them sit, covered, at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes before rolling them out. Roll out according to the instructions for your cavatelli maker. For most tabletop models, you roll the dough into a rope to about ½-inch (13 cm) thickness, flatten it slightly, flour it well, and then feed it into your cavatelli maker. Secure the cavatelli maker to your work surface, then flour the dough and feed each sheet into it. Dust the cavatelli with flour and use immediately. You can also freeze them in an airtight container for up to 1 month. Take the cavatelli straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the olive oil in a large, deep sauté pan over medium-low heat. Add the Spanish onion and sweat it, stirring occasionally, until it is soft but not browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and season them aggressively with salt. Cook the tomatoes slowly until they break down but remain chunky, about 1 hour, gently mashing them once they start to soften. Stir from time to time until the tomatoes and oil, and then taste the sauce, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Use the sauce within 3 hours, or transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to 2 days or freeze it for up to 1 month.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the grapeseed oil in a large saucepan or deep sauté pan over medium-high heat until it starts to smoke. Working in batches if necessary to prevent crowding, add the eggplant slices and fry, stirring to cook them evenly, until they are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried eggplant to paper towels to drain.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Turn down the heat to medium, add the red onions to the oil remaining in the pan and cook, stirring now and then, until nicely caramelized, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain off the excess oil (it can be cooled and reused for other frying) and then stir in the eggplant back into the pan. Taste the mixture, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Use immediately or refrigerate the mixture in an airtight container for up to 8 hours.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the cavatelli and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, add the eggplant mixture to the pan of tomato sauce and warm the mixture over medium heat. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the cavatelli by transferring them to the sauce in the pan. Reserve the pasta water. Add 1½ cups (355 ml) of the pasta water, raise the heat to medium-high, and toss until the sauce reduces slightly, gets creamy, and coats the pasta, 1 to 2 minutes. Add a little more oil or pasta water if necessary to create a creamy sauce. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the basil, parsley, and pepper flakes. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates and shave ricotta salata over each serving.</li>
        </ol>
