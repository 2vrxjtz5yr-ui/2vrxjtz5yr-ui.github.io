        <p itemprop="description">If you've never had perfect potato gnocchi, skip the corn crema and salad and just put the gnocchi on a plate and top them with melted butter and grated Parmesan. That is the best way to eat perfect gnocchi. But for something more special, I like to brown the gnocchi in a sauté pan, spoon on a creamy corn sauce, and top them with a fresh corn salad and some shaved ricotta salata. Don't even think about making this dish in the winter. Save it for summer or early fall when corn is in season.</p>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (60 ml) olive oil</li>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2 itemprop="recipeInstructions">Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the gnocchi, combine the potatoes (unpeeled) and salted water to cover by 1 inch (2.5 cm) in a saucepan. Cover, bring the water to a boil over high heat, and boil until a knife slides easily in and out of the potatoes, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
            
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat and transfer the potatoes to a cutting board. Immediately peel off and discard the skins. Wear gloves if the potatoes feel too hot to handle. Coarsely chop the potatoes, and then pass them through a potato ricer or a food mill fitted with the fine die onto a large, lightly floured cutting board or smooth work surface, covering the board or surface with the potatoes. (Spreading out the potatoes helps to evaporate excess moisture.) Let the potatoes stand for 5 minutes, and then sprinkle ¼ cup (25 g) of the Parmesan and the nutmeg evenly over the top. Season the potatoes with salt and pepper and then use a bench scraper to cut all of the seasonings into the potatoes, repeatedly scraping and mixing the ingredients until well blended. Taste the mixture, adding more salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Use the bench scraper to stir in the egg. Finally, gently stir in the flour just until the dough comes together.</li>
            
            <li>Gently knead the dough just until it has a uniform consistency, about 1 minute. Be careful not to overwork the dough or it will develop excess gluten, which will make the gnocchi tough. Flour the bench scraper or a knife to cut the dough into 4 pieces. Roll each piece on the floured surface into a long rope about ½ inch (12 mm) in diameter. Use the ½-inch bench scraper or knife to cut the rope crosswise into ½-inch (12 mm) pieces. You can cook the pillows as they are or you can press your thumb into each piece to create a slight indentation. Or, for the traditional potato gnocchi shape, roll each piece on a lightly floured grooved gnocchi board, pressing one cut side of the dough with your thumb to create a grooved oval shape with a gap in the middle. Let the dough roll around your thumb as you press and roll it on the board. You can also use a clean comb or the tines of a fork to create the grooves. As the gnocchi are formed, transfer them to a generously floured rimmed baking sheet and shake the baking sheet to dust the gnocchi with the flour. You should have about 240 small gnocchi.</li>
            
            <li>Cover the gnocchi loosely and refrigerate them for up to 8 hours, or freeze them in a single layer and then transfer them to a zipper-lock bag and freeze them for up to 2 weeks. Take the gnocchi straight from the freezer to the boiling water, adding 30 seconds or so to the cooking time.</li>
            
            <li>To make the crema, cut the corn kernels from the ears of corn, then scrape the cobs to extract as much juice as possible, capturing the kernels and juice in a bowl. Heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the grapeseed oil in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and sweat them until they are soft but not browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add half of the corn kernels and all of the corn juice (equal to 3 ears corn) and the bay leaf. Season the mixture generously with salt to bring out more juices from the corn. Turn down the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the corn is very tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the cream and continue to cook until the flavors blend, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            
            <li>Remove and discard the garlic and bay leaf and transfer to the mixture to a blender. Puree the mixture until very smooth, 2 to 3 minutes, scraping down the sides at least once. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Strain the mixture through a medium-mesh sieve and use the crema within 1 hour or refrigerate it in an airtight container for up to 2 days. You should have about 2½ cups (592 ml) crema.</li>
            
            <li>To make the corn salad, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 ml) grapeseed oil in a large sauté pan over high heat. When the pan is hot, add the remaining corn kernels and cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until they are charred in spots, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and add the green onions and pepper flakes. Taste the salad, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Set aside in the pan.</li>
            
            <li>Have ready a bowl of ice water. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop the gnocchi into the boiling water, in batches if necessary to prevent crowding, and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a low boil. Adjust the heat so that the water simmers, stirring gently. Cook the gnocchi until springy to the touch and tender throughout, 3 to 5 minutes. Squeeze a dumpling between your fingers. It should have some bounce-back. If it just flattens, the gnocchi are not done yet. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, immediately transfer the gnocchi to the ice water and let them sit in the water for 30 seconds to stop the cooking. Transfer the gnocchi to dry kitchen towels and pat them dry.</li>
            
            <li>To serve, heat the butter and olive oil in a large nonstick sauté pan over high heat. Add the gnocchi, in batches if necessary to prevent crowding, and sauté them until they are golden brown on both sides, 5 to 6 minutes total. Dish out the sautéed gnocchi onto warmed plates.</li>
            
            <li>Meanwhile, reheat the corn crema in a saucepan and the corn salad in the sauté pan. Spoon about ¼ cup (60 ml) of the crema over each plate of gnocchi. Top with the corn salad. Using a Microplane or other fine-rasp grater, finely grate some ricotta salata over each serving.</li>
