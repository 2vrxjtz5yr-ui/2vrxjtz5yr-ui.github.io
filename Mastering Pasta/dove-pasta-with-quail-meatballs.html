            <p>This light first course combines meatballs and pasta in broth. If you don't want to make the quail stock, you can use a mix of chicken stock (page 242) and duck stock (page 242). And if you cannot find bagoss cheese, Bitto works well. You could even use Parmesan. You'll need a fine-mesh drying screen to make this pasta (see Sources, page 249).</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces (112 g) Dove Pasta Dough (page 177), rolled into sheets between ⅛ inch and 3/16 inch (3 mm and 1.5 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups (200 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (110 g) plain dried bread crumbs</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 eggs</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon (3 g) kosher salt</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ teaspoon (1 g) freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2½ cups (591 ml) quail stock (page 242)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Tipo 00 or all-purpose flour, for dusting meatballs</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 ripe plum, halved, pitted, and cut into very thin half-moons (18 to 24 slices)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 ripe apricot, halved, pitted, and cut into very thin half-moon slices (18 to 24 slices)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (114 g) grated bagoss, Bitto, or Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 fresh mint leaves, cut into chiffonade</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Quail Meatballs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1¼ pounds (567 g) whole semiboneless quail (about 4)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4½ ounces (128 g) pork fatback, cut into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured surface and trim the edges square. Cut the pasta into 2-inch (5 cm) squares with a crimp-cut cutter (the cuts should look square rather than like a zigzag). Stack about 5 squares at a time and use a sharp knife to cut the stack in half on the diagonal to make stacks of triangles. Use the tip of the knife to cut out a ½-inch (12 mm) triangular notch on each crimp-cut side about ½ inch (12 mm) away from the right angle of the triangle. The result should resemble a flat bird with wings on either side. To make the shape three-dimensional, pick up a piece and lightly spritz it with water. Then, pinch the longest side—the straight-cut side—of the triangle at the center to fold in the two sides, sort of like making a paper airplane, to bring the two "wings" of the dove shape closer together. When doing this, pinch together only about ½ inch (12 mm) of the dough just at the longest side to make the body of the dove, leaving the rest of the triangle flat (the wings). Invert the dove pasta onto a flat pasta drying screen so that the pinched side is pointing up. Repeat with the remaining dough. You should have about 50 pieces of dove pasta. Dry the pasta on the screen at room temperature (about 70°F/21°C) for 2 days.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">To make the meatballs, remove the bones from the quail and reserve them for making quail stock. You should have about 1 pound (454 g) quail meat and skin. Put the fatback and the quail in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and freeze until partially frozen, about 10 minutes. Pile the quail, fatback, meat bowl and paddle attachment and all the parts of a meat grinder in the freezer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Grind the cold quail (skin and meat) and fatback on the small die of the meat grinder into the cold bowl. If you don't have a meat grinder, you can chop them in a food processor, using short pulses until very finely chopped but not puréed. In the mixer with the cold paddle attachment, add the Parmesan, bread crumbs, eggs, salt, and pepper to the bowl, and mix on medium-low speed until blended.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Pinch off 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces of the quail mixture and gently roll them between your palms into 1-inch (2.5 cm) balls. You should have about 35 meatballs. Use them within 1 hour or refrigerate them in an airtight container for up to 1 day.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the quail stock in a large pot over medium heat until it comes to a gentle simmer. Add the meatballs and simmer until they are cooked through, about 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the dove pasta and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, transfer the pasta to the simmering stock and meatballs. Add the plum and apricot slices and simmer gently for 1 to 2 minutes to warm through.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Ladle the pasta, meatballs, fruit, and broth into warmed bowls. Garnish with the grated bagoss cheese and mint chiffonade.</li>
        </ol>
