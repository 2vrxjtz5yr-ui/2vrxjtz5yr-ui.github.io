    <h1>Culurgiones with Sweetbreads and Corn</h1>
    <p class="yield">Makes 6 to 8 servings</p>
    
    <div class="intro">
        <p>If you look up this pasta, you'll find all sorts of spellings. They're all correct. That's just how Italy is. No one wants to tell others that they can't do something their own way! <em>Culurgiones</em> come from Sardinia, where local cooks sculpt dough into elaborate breads for weddings and other celebrations. They look like stuffed teardrops with a series of folds or braids over the top. Traditionally they are filled with potatoes, but in the summer, I like to use pureed corn. A mixture of fresh corn kernels and crispy sweetbreads makes a nice condiment, too. But try different fillings. The important thing is that the filling not be too loose. It has to have some body to ensure the <em>culurgiones</em> hold their shape. For help with the braiding technique, check out some videos online.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>DOUGH SWAP</strong> Unlike most other ravioli doughs, this one is a semolina dough. There's no egg, and the protein in the semolina makes the dough sturdy enough to be shaped. You could, however, flavor this dough with some minced fresh flat-leaf parsley or basil.
    </div>

    <div class="ingredients">
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon (15 g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 ears corn, shucked and kernels cut from cobs</li>
            <li>2 ounces (57 g) Chevrot (cave-aged French goat cheese) or Montrachet cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (13 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (14 g) plain dried bread crumbs</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sweetbreads</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 ounces (170 g) veal sweetbreads, preferably thymus</li>
            <li>3 ears corn, shucked and kernels cut from cobs</li>
            <li>3 ounces (85 g) pecorino al tartufo cheese (truffle pecorino)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (6 g) thinly sliced fresh chives (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pasta</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound (454 g) Culurgione Dough (page 29), rolled into sheets about ⅟₁₆ inch (1.5 mm) thick</li>
            <li>½ cup (170 g) unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        
        <h3>Make the Filling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the corn kernels and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and lightly browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a food processor, add the Chevrot and Parmesan, and process the mixture, scraping down the sides once or twice, until it is very smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the bread crumbs and process until blended, then taste the filling, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Add the egg and process until blended. Spoon the filling into a zipper-lock bag, seal closed, and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Prepare the Sweetbreads</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To prepare the sweetbreads, rinse them in cold water, then soak them in a bowl of ice water for 10 minutes. Drain them, pat dry, and carefully remove the outer membrane and any veins or gristle. Finely chop the sweetbreads and season them all over with salt and pepper. Set them aside, or if not using them within 5 to 10 minutes, cover and refrigerate them for up to 2 hours. (Organ meats spoil easily, so it is important to keep the sweetbreads cold right up until you cook them.)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Shape the Culurgiones</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Using a round cutter 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) in diameter, cut the dough into circles. Snip a corner from the bag of filling and, starting at each of the long edges, pipe 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces of filling in two rows along the length of the sheet, leaving a 1½-inch (4 cm) margin around each piece (3 inches/7.5 cm total between rows). Lightly mist the dough with water to keep it from drying out and to help create a good seal. Fold the long edge of the pasta closest to you over one row of filling. Fold the opposite long edge over the other row of filling. Use your fingers to press out the air around each ball of filling. Using a round cutter (preferably fluted) 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter, punch out ravioli along the rows. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. As the ravioli are formed, transfer them to floured rimmed baking sheets. You should have 25 to 30 <em>culurgiones</em>.</li>
            <li>Cover the <em>culurgiones</em> and use them within 1 hour. You can also refrigerate them for up to 4 hours, or freeze them in a single layer until frozen solid, transfer them to zipper-lock bags, and freeze them for up to 2 weeks. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Cook and Serve</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches to prevent crowding, drop in the <em>culurgiones</em> and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a low boil. Gently cook the <em>culurgiones</em> until they are tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the oil and garlic in a large, deep sauté pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add all of the peppers and cook them, stirring now and then, until they are very tender and lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add 1½ cups (355 ml) of the pasta water and cook the sauce until it thickens slightly, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove and discard the garlic.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the corn and sweetbreads and cook until they are both nicely browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and cover it to keep the corn and sweetbreads warm.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches to prevent crowding, drop in the <em>culurgiones</em> and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a low boil. Gently cook the <em>culurgiones</em> until they are tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the <em>culurgiones</em> and transfer them directly to the pan of sauce. Gently toss and stir until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan, adding a little more pasta water if necessary to create a creamy sauce.</li>
            <li>Dish out the <em>culurgiones</em> onto warmed plates and garnish with the Parmesan. Grate the pecorino over the <em>culurgiones</em>, and then spoon the corn and sweetbread mixture over the top. Garnish with the chives.</li>
        </ol>
