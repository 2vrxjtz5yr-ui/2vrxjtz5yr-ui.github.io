            <p>The trick with these dumplings is to undercook them ever so slightly. You want the cheese to still be oozy when you serve them. For a stronger goat cheese flavor, replace the ricotta with more fresh goat cheese. Or, if you want it really strong, keep the ricotta and replace the fresh goat cheese with Gorgonzola.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (250 g) ricotta impastata cheese (see page 241)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups plus 3 tablespoons (250 g) crumbled soft fresh goat cheese</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">⅛ teaspoon (0.3 g) freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¾ cup (115 grams) tipo 00 flour, or ¾ cup plus 3 tablespoons (115 g) all-purpose flour, plus some for dusting</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ egg, beaten</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 to 6 thin slices prosciutto (about 2 ounces/55 g), cut into strips ½ inch (12 mm) wide strips</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (114 g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 chunk firm aged goat cheese, for shaving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Put the ricotta and fresh goat cheese in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed until well combined. On low speed, add the nutmeg and flour and mix until just combined. Taste the mixture, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Add the egg and mix just until well blended. Use the dough within 1 hour or cover and refrigerate it for up to 1 day.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer the dough to a lightly floured cutting board or smooth work surface. Flour a bench scraper or a knife and cut the dough into 4 pieces. The dough will be very soft. Gently roll each piece on the floured surface into a long rope about ½ inch (12 mm) in diameter. Using the floured bench scraper or knife, cut the ropes crosswise into ½-inch (12 mm) pieces. Flour your hands, then dip each piece in flour and roll each piece on a lightly floured grooved gnocchi board, pressing one cut side of the dough with your thumb to create a grooved oval shape with a gap in the middle. You can also use a clean comb or the tines of a fork to create the grooves. As the gnocchi are formed, transfer them to a generously floured rimmed baking sheet and shake the baking sheet to dust the gnocchi with the flour. You should have about 150 gnocchi.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Use the gnocchi immediately, or cover them loosely and refrigerate them for up to 4 hours. You can also freeze them in a single layer, transfer them to a zipper-lock bag, and freeze them for up to 2 weeks. Take the gnocchi straight from the freezer to the boiling water, adding 30 seconds or so to the cooking time.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Turn on the convection, if possible. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Lay the prosciutto strips in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet and bake them until they are crispy like fried bacon, about 4 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Melt the butter in a sauté pan over medium heat and cook until the liquid looks golden and the milk solids brown on the bottom of the pan, 6 to 8 minutes. Keep warm over low heat.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the gnocchi, in batches if necessary to prevent crowding, and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a low boil. Gently cook the gnocchi until springy to the touch and tender throughout, 3 to 5 minutes. Squeeze a dumpling between your fingers. It should have some bounce-back. If it just flattens, the gnocchi are not done yet.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the gnocchi, letting them drip-dry for a moment, then dish them out onto warmed plates. Spoon the brown butter over the gnocchi, and then shave 2 or 3 slices of aged goat cheese over each serving. Top each serving with prosciutto crisps.</li>
        </ol>
