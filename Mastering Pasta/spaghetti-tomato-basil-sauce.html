            <p>For this dish, I actually don't like to use Parmesan on top. I like it fresh and clean so you can really taste the tomato and basil. It's one of those dishes where if anything is just a little off, the whole dish is ruined. Use the best canned tomatoes and olive oil you can get, and be sure to emulsify the oil and pasta water to create a creamy sauce.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces (340 g) Extruded Semolina Dough (page 120)</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Semolina, for dusting</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (60 ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 clove garlic, smashed</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (240 g) whole canned San Marzano tomatoes</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ teaspoon (0.5 g) red pepper flakes</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">10 fresh basil leaves, torn into pieces</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Fit your pasta extruder or stand-mixer attachment with the chilled spaghetti plate. If using a pasta extruder, set it to medium speed. If using a stand mixer, with the machine running on medium speed, feed the dough into the hopper in marble-size clumps, using a pushing tool to push the clumps into the auger, being careful not to overload it. As the pasta is extruded, cut it into 9-inch (23 cm) lengths and immediately dust it with semolina to prevent sticking.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dry the pasta by placing it on wire racks that will fit in your refrigerator and refrigerate it uncovered for at least 8 hours or up to 4 days. The pasta will get drier and harder as it sits. I like the texture after 2 days in the refrigerator. For more bite, dry the pasta with a humidifier as described on page 120, and then store it in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 month.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oil and garlic in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. Keep the heat on medium so you don't burn the garlic. A little brown is okay. After about 2 minutes, add the tomatoes, crushing them with your hands as you add them to the pan. Lower the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes. You want the tomatoes cooked—not with a raw tomato flavor; there's a big difference.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the spaghetti and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 4 to 6 minutes (8 to 10 minutes for fully dried boxed pasta). Drain the pasta and reserve the pasta water.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the drained pasta to the pan along with ½ cup (118 ml) of the pasta water. Toss and cook together over medium-high heat until the sauce reduces in volume slightly, gets creamy, and coats the pasta. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you but is slightly underseasoned. Add the basil leaves and toss again.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates and garnish with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
