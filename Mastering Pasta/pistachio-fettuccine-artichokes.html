            <p>Years ago, I made this dish over and over. It was so good. But I never wrote down a recipe. I made it again recently, but this time I wrote down the proportions for the pasta made with ground pistachios and pistachio oil. It tasted just like I remembered it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>PASTA SWAP:</strong> Thinner tagliolini works well, or use plain fettuccine instead of pistachio.
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (227 g) Pistachio Dough (page 145), rolled into sheets about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (30 ml) fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 cups (473 ml) water</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 baby artichokes</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (114 g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (60 ml) pistachio oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">⅔ cup (67 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (38 g) shelled, peeled and chopped pistachios, preferably Sicilian</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the edges square. Cut the sheet into 9-inch (23 cm) lengths. Fit your stand mixer or pasta machine with the fettuccine cutter and set it to medium speed. Feed 1 length of dough at a time through the cutter, dusting the dough lightly with flour as it is cut into strands. Coil the fettuccine into nests and set them on a floured rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining sheets. Use the fettuccine within 1 hour or freeze it in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Take the pasta right from the freezer to the boiling pasta water, adding 30 seconds or so to the cooking time.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Combine the lemon juice and water in a bowl. Working with 1 artichoke at a time, snap off and discard all of the fibrous outer leaves. Using a paring knife, trim the artichoke until you are left with pale green leaves in a bullet shape about 1 inch by ½ inch (2.5 by 1 cm) in size. As each artichoke is trimmed, drop it into the lemon water to keep it from browning. When all of the artichokes have been trimmed, lift them from the water, quarter them lengthwise for a rustic effect (as shown in the photo) or chop them into ¼-inch (6 mm) pieces for a more refined effect, and return the pieces to the lemon water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the fettuccine, cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil, and cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. Drain the artichokes and add them to the pan along with 2 cups (473 ml) of the pasta water. Simmer the mixture until the artichokes are tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the pasta by transferring it to the pan with the artichokes. Add the pistachio oil and toss over medium heat until the sauce reduces slightly, gets creamy, and coats the pasta, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and add ½ cup (50 g) of the Parmesan. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates and garnish with the remaining Parmesan and the pistachios.</li>
        </ol>
