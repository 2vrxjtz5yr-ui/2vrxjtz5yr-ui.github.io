        <p itemprop="description">The key here is adding the shellfish at the very end of the cooking—just so it warms through. If you add it too early, it starts to release water and gets rubbery. But cooked gently until it's barely warm, the shellfish makes this a magical, creamy dish. If you're adding whole shellfish like clams and mussels in the shell, stir them in near the end of cooking along with the pepper flakes. As the shellfish opens, some of its juices will hydrate and flavor the rice.</p>

    <div class="ingredients">
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 ounces (170 grams) mixed shellfish (such as peeled whole medium shrimp and/or chopped sea scallops, cleaned and chopped squid, or lobster meat)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">7 tablespoons (105 ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon (4 g) chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 basil leaves, julienned</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons (31 g) chopped yellow onion</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">⅔ cup (98 g) Carnaroli rice</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (60 ml) dry white wine</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (60 g) whole canned San Marzano tomatoes</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 to 4 cups (710 to 946 ml) shellfish stock (page 243), heated to a boil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Toss the shellfish with 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of the oil, the parsley, and the basil in a bowl. Let the mixture stand at room temperature while you make the risotto.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of the oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and sweat it until it is soft but not browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the rice and sauté the rice until it is translucent around the edges and starts to brown a little, 2 to 3 minutes. This is an important step to develop the right flavor and texture in the rice; make sure the rice absorbs some of the oil. Pour in the wine and simmer it until the pan goes dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes, crushing them with your hand as you add them to the pan. Simmer the mixture for 2 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Gradually add 3½ cups (828 ml) of the boiling stock about ½ cup (118 ml) at a time, stirring almost constantly over medium-high heat until the rice absorbs the stock after each addition. When the rice is done, it should be tender but still a little chewy when bitten and should have released most of its starch, creating a creamy sauce in the pan. This process will take 25 to 30 minutes. Near the end of cooking, add the pepper flakes and the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 ml) oil, stirring the rice like crazy to release as much starch as possible and create the sauce. If necessary, add more stock to create a creamy sauce. Drag your spoon through the rice to the bottom of the pan; the sauce should slowly fill in the line you made.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the seafood mixture, stirring like crazy until the heat released from the seafood blends with the sauce. Return the pan to medium-low heat and cook until the seafood is just opaque, 3 to 4 minutes. Add more boiling stock if necessary to create a thick, creamy sauce. Taste the risotto, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the risotto onto warmed plates.</li>
