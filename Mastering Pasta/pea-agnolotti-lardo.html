    <h1>Pea Agnolotti with Lardo</h1>
    <p class="yield">Makes 6 servings</p>
    
    <div class="intro">
        <p>Winter, spring, summer, and fall—I make agnolotti every season. People love the rectangular shape and the fillings are countless, from beets and cheese to corn and squash. In the spring, sweet peas are perfect. <em>Lardo</em> adds a burst of salt and fat to finish the dish. If you can't get your hands on <em>lardo</em>, use thinly sliced pancetta instead.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>DOUGH SWAP</strong> For especially tender ravioli, use Rich Egg Yolk Dough (page 29), or for a little more chew, use Whole Egg and Yolk Dough (page 29).
    </div>

    <div class="ingredients">
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1½ cups (220 g) shelled green peas (from about 3 pounds/1.4 kg peas in their pod)</li>
            <li>4 ounces (112 g) robiola cheese</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ egg (beat a whole egg, then pour out half)</li>
            <li>8 ounces (227 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into sheets about ⅟₃₂ inch (0.8 mm) thick</li>
            <li>½ cup (114 g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup (25 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 ounces (57 g) lardo, sliced paper-thin</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Have ready a bowl of ice water. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Drop in the peas and blanch them until they are bright green, about 30 seconds. Drain the peas and transfer them to the ice water to stop the cooking. Drain again and transfer them to a food processor. Add the cheese and puree the mixture until it is very smooth, about 1 minute. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Add the egg and process until blended. Spoon the filling into a zipper-lock bag, seal closed, and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day.</li>
            <li>Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Snip a corner from the bag of filling and pipe ½-inch (12 mm) balls of filling in two rows along the length of the sheet, leaving a 1½-inch (4 cm) margin around each ball. Cut the pasta sheet in half lengthwise between the rows of filling to make two long sheets. Lightly mist the dough with water to keep it from drying out and to help create a good seal. Fold the outside edge of the dough over to cover the filling, and then fold the dough over again. Press out the air around each ball of filling, starting at one end of the sheet and working your way to the opposite end. Place a finger gently on the filling to create a dimple, and then cut between the balls of filling, preferably with a fluted cutter, to create rectangular agnolotti. Repeat the process with the remaining pasta dough and filling. As the agnolotti are formed, transfer them to floured rimmed baking sheets. You should have 75 to 100 agnolotti.</li>
            <li>Cover the agnolotti and use them within 1 hour or refrigerate them for up to 8 hours. You can also freeze the agnolotti in a single layer, transfer them to zipper-lock bags, and freeze them for up to 2 weeks. Take the agnolotti right from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches to prevent crowding, drop in the agnolotti and cover the pot to quickly to a low boil. Gently cook the agnolotti until they are tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. Add 1 cup (237 ml) of the pasta water and stir like crazy until the liquid is blended and emulsified, 1 to 2 minutes. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the agnolotti and transfer them directly to the pan of sauce. Gently toss and stir until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan, adding a little more pasta water if necessary to create a creamy sauce.</li>
            <li>Dish out the agnolotti onto warmed plates and garnish with the Parmesan and <em>lardo</em>.</li>
        </ol>
