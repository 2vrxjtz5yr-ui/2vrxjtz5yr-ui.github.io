            <p>Cannelloni is a recent pasta in Italian culinary history, first appearing on menus and in cookbooks in the 1900s. Despite its relative youth, I think it's safe to call it classic. And the eggplant, Parmesan, and tomato? That's another classic combination. This dish is a win-win.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Eggplant Cannelloni</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 globe eggplants (about 2 lb/907 g total)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¾ cup (75 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (225 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into sheets a little less than 1⁄16 inch (3 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tablespoons (57 g) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Parmesan Crema</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (237 ml) heavy cream</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (50 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Heirloom Tomato Salad</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 heirloom tomatoes, finely diced</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¼ cup (60 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon (5 ml) red wine vinegar</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 large fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">To make the cannelloni, heat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise and score each half in a large crosshatch pattern with a sharp knife. Set the eggplants, cut side up, on a rimmed baking sheet, season them with salt and pepper, and drizzle with oil.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Roast the eggplants until they are very tender and start to collapse, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cut a piece of cheesecloth into a rectangle measuring about 12 by 18 inches (31 by 46 cm). Let the eggplants cool slightly, then scoop the flesh from the skins into the cheesecloth. Bring the corners of the cheesecloth together and tie securely with kitchen string. Hang the eggplant over a large bowl. Place the bowl in the refrigerator overnight to drain away the excess water from the eggplant.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer the drained eggplant to a bowl and stir in ½ cup (50 g) of the Parmesan. Taste the mixture, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Stir in the egg and then transfer the mixture to a zipper-lock bag, seal closed, and refrigerate for up to 1 day.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and cut it into 4-inch (10 cm) squares. Repeat with the remaining sheets. You should get 8 to 10 squares from each sheet, or 16 to 20 total. As you work, lightly mist the pasta with water to keep it from drying out.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches to prevent crowding, drop in the pasta and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Blanch the pasta for 15 to 20 seconds, stirring gently to prevent sticking. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, transfer the pasta squares to kitchen towels or paper towels, laying them flat and patting them dry. The pieces will be delicate and some may stick, but you should have plenty.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oven to 500°F (260°C). Turn on the convection, if possible. Butter a 3-quart (3 L) baking dish.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Snip a corner from the bag holding the eggplant mixture and pipe a line of the filling 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick along one edge of each pasta square. Starting at the filled side, use the edge of the towel to lift and roll the pasta to enclose the filling. Transfer the cannelloni, seam side down, to the baking dish and top them with the butter pieces and the remaining ¼ cup (25 g) Parmesan.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bake the cannelloni until the cheese melts and browns on top, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, make the crema and tomato salad. To make the crema, bring the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the Parmesan until melted and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and strain the crema through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean small saucepan. Keep the crema warm over low heat.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">To make the salad, stir together the tomatoes, oil, and vinegar in a bowl. Stack the basil leaves into 2 or 3 stacks, roll up each stack lengthwise, and cut crosswise into very thin slices (chiffonade). Add the basil to the bowl and toss gently to mix everything together. Taste the salad, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Spoon a pool of the crema onto 6 warmed plates. Place 2 or 3 cannelloni on each plate. Using a slotted spoon, scoop up some of the tomato salad and spoon it over the top of each serving.</li>
        </ol>
