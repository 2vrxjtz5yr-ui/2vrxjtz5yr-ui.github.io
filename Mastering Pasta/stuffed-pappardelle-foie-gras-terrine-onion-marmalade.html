            <p>This ravioli was a Paolo Begnini invention. He's the chef at Osteria della Brughiera in a small town in Bergamo Province in Lombardy. When I came back from Italy with Jeff Michaud, the chef at Osteria in Philadelphia, we were both screaming, "This is the coolest thing ever!" We made this dish at Vetri for a year after our return. It's ridiculously rich, so you can't eat it every day. But every once in a while, it's unbelievable. Note that a whole foie gras will come with two lobes for a total weight of about 2 pounds (907 g). Separate the lobes and use the smaller one for this recipe. Or use both, adjusting the salt and sugar amounts for the total weight. You can keep the foie gras terrine in the freezer for 2 months.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <h3>Foie Gras Terrine</h3>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 small lobe foie gras (about 12 oz/340 g)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt, 1.8 percent of the weight of the foie gras (for 12 oz foie gras, that's 2¼ teaspoons/0.22 oz/6.2 g)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Sugar, 1 percent of the weight of the foie gras (for 12 oz foie gras, that's ¾ teaspoon/0.12 oz/3.4 g)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Onion Marmalade</h3>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 tablespoons (57 g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 Spanish onions, thinly sliced into half-moons</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Parmesan Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (100 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (118 ml) heavy cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Assembly</h3>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 to 5 tablespoons (27 to 34 g) plain dried bread crumbs</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces (340 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into sheets about 1/32 inch (0.8 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (114 g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Grated Parmesan cheese, for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        
        <h3>Make the Foie Gras Terrine</h3>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a 13 by 4 by 4-inch (33 by 10 by 10 cm) terrine mold or a 9 by 5 by 3-inch (23 by 13 by 7.5 cm) loaf pan with parchment paper, with enough hanging over the edges to cover the terrine.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">You need to remove the veins from the foie gras because they are tough and chewy. First, let the liver stand at room temperature for 15 minutes to allow it to soften up. Spread a large sheet of plastic wrap on a work surface and set the lobe vertically on the plastic. Using a paring knife, remove any visible veins and the membrane from the outside of the lobe. Remove any green bile. Slowly and gently open up and spread apart the lobe from the top to bottom to find the primary vein, which runs from the top to the bottom. Dig with your fingers, gently pushing the liver a little more on either side of the large vein to reveal the small veins running off it like branches on a tree. Once all the veins are exposed, use a paring knife or your fingers to pick up the large vein from one end and gradually pull it and the attached branches away from the liver, gently tugging it and scraping it out bit by bit, leaving the liver on the plastic. Discard all the veins. Dig a little deeper to make sure you have removed every last vein. The foie gras may look ruined, but don't worry. You will rebuild it. Season it all over with the salt and sugar, and then reshape it into a semiflat disk resembling its original shape, using the plastic wrap to help reshape it if needed.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Transfer the foie gras to an ovenproof sauté pan or rimmed baking sheet and warm it in the oven until it reaches an internal temperature of 90°F (32°C), 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the foie gras from the melted fat in the pan (discard the fat) and transfer it to the prepared mold, using the parchment paper to form it into a neat cylinder about 3 inches (7.5 cm) in diameter. If it has completely disintegrated in the pan, you can reemulsify it by pureeing it in a food processor, and then pour it into the prepared mold. Cover the foie gras with the overhanging parchment and then top it with a heavy weight to compact it. Freeze the terrine until solid, at least 3 hours. The foie gras can be kept wrapped in the parchment in a zipper-lock bag in the freezer for up to 2 months.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Make the Onion Marmalade</h3>
        <ol start="4">
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">To make the marmalade, melt the butter in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onions and salt and toss the onions to coat them with the butter. Cook the onions slowly, stirring occasionally, until they shed their water and go from translucent to light golden brown to deep caramel brown and are almost disintegrated, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Stir in a little water now and then if necessary to keep the onions from burning on the bottom. Taste the marmalade, adding salt until it tastes good to you. You should have about ¾ cup onion marmalade. Use it within 4 hours or transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to 1 week.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Make the Parmesan Filling</h3>
        <ol start="5">
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">To make the Parmesan filling, whisk together the Parmesan and cream in a bowl; the mixture will look soupy. Stir in 4 tablespoons (27 g) of the bread crumbs. At this point, the mixture should look like a creamy paste. If it still looks soupy, add the remaining 1 tablespoon (22 g) at a time, to thicken it a bit. Taste the filling, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Stir in the egg. You should have about 2 cups of filling. Spoon the filling into a zipper-lock bag, seal closed, and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Shape the Ravioli</h3>
        <ol start="6">
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the edges square. Fold the sheet in half crosswise and cut a small notch at the fold to mark the center of the sheet. Unfold the sheet so it lies flat again. Snip a corner from the bag of filling and pipe columns of the filling ½ inch (12 mm) wide crosswise on the sheet, leaving a ½-inch (12 mm) margin between the columns and stopping about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the center mark. Lightly mist the dough with water to keep it from drying out and to help create a good seal. Lift up the empty side of the sheet and fold it over to cover the fillings. Press a dowel or clean round pencil between and against the filling to neaten up the columns. Using a knife or fluted cutting wheel, cut between the columns of filling to make ravioli about 4 inches (10 cm) long and 1½ inches (4 cm) wide. Each ravioli should resemble a piece of stuffed pappardelle. Repeat with the remaining pasta and filling. As the ravioli are formed, transfer them to floured rimmed baking sheets. You should have about 30 ravioli.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Cover the ravioli and use them within 1 hour. You can also refrigerate them for up to 4 hours, or freeze them in a single layer until frozen solid, transfer them to zipper-lock bags, and freeze them for up to 2 weeks. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Cook and Serve</h3>
        <ol start="8">
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Melt the butter in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. Cook the butter until it turns golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes, and then stir in ½ cup of the onion marmalade. Reserve the remaining marmalade for another use.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the ravioli and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a low boil. Gently cook the ravioli until they are tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the ravioli, letting them drip-dry for a moment, then arrange them nicely on warmed plates.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Garnish the servings with the Parmesan and spoon the hot onion marmalade over the top. Using a microplane or other fine-rasp grater, generously shave the frozen terrine over the pasta.</li>
        </ol>
