            <p>You could use cow's milk ricotta here, but the tang of sheep's milk adds another dimension to the Swiss chard. The combination is a play on the typical spinach ricotta filling found so often in ravioli and lasagna. Why is that combination so popular? Because it works.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound (454 g) Swiss chard</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 pounds (907 g) sheep's milk ricotta cheese</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ teaspoon (1 g) grated nutmeg</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ egg (beat a whole egg, then pour out half)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces (340 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into sheets about 1⁄16 inch (1.5 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ cups (150 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1¼ cups (355 ml) béchamel with onion (page 245), warmed</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">18 fresh sage leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the tough stems from the chard and discard or reserve for another use. Keep the leaves whole or coarsely chop them. Heat the oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the chard and sauté until it begins to wilt, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the leaves to a cutting board, let cool, and finely chop. Squeeze out any excess liquid, then transfer the chard to a bowl and stir in the ricotta and nutmeg. Taste the mixture, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Stir in the egg.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the edges square. Cut the pasta into 5-inch (12 cm) squares. Repeat with the remaining sheets. You should get about 6 squares from each sheet or 18 total. Use them immediately, or freeze them in a single layer, transfer them to a zipper-lock bag, and freeze them for up to 1 month. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oven to 475°F (245°C). Turn on the convection, if possible. Generously butter 2 rimmed baking sheets or six 2-cup (473 ml) individual baking dishes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Have ready a large bowl of ice water. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches to prevent crowding, drop in the pasta squares and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Blanch the pasta for 15 to 20 seconds, stirring gently to prevent sticking. Using a spider strainer or tongs, immediately transfer the pasta squares to the ice water to stop the cooking. Lay the squares flat on clean kitchen towels or paper towels and pat them dry.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Place about 3 tablespoons (43 g) of the ricotta mixture in the center of a square. Top with 1 teaspoon (2 g) of the Parmesan. Fold the square in half over the filling to form a triangle, gently spreading out the filling to make the pasta as flat as possible. Repeat the step with more ricotta and Parmesan, placing them in the center of the triangle, and fold the triangle in half again to form a smaller triangle; leave the pasta a little lumpier in the center like ravioli. Repeat with the remaining pasta squares and filling. Place the fazzoletti on the prepared baking sheets or in the prepared baking dishes, allowing 3 fazzoletti per serving and leaving a little room between them. Spread a scant tablespoon (15 ml) of béchamel over the entire surface of each fazzoletto, and then top each one with 1 sage leaf and a sprinkle of Parmesan.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bake the fazzoletti until bubbly and lightly browned on top, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Divide the fazzoletti among warmed plates if baked on baking sheets, allowing 3 fazzoletti per serving, or leave in the individual baking dishes. Top each serving with a sprinkle of the remaining Parmesan and a grind of pepper.</li>
        </ol>
