    <h1>Branzino Ravioli with Tomato Butter Sauce</h1>
    <p class="yield">Makes 6 to 8 servings</p>
    
    <div class="intro">
        <p>Fish ravioli? You'll be amazed. It's light, beautiful, and easy. Just use fatty fish and the filling will bind itself together without any egg or bread crumbs. I like to fillet a couple of whole branzino, but you can use 1 pound (454 g) skinless branzino fillets or even salmon, yellowtail, or tuna belly. For the tomatoes, use whatever you have on hand, canned or fresh. Tomato <em>concassé</em> (see page 150) is even better.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>DOUGH SWAP</strong> This dish is all about subtlety—not big flavors. An herb dough like Basil Dough (page 145) would be perfect.
    </div>

    <div class="ingredients">
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound (454 g) skinless branzino fillets, very finely chopped (about 3 cups total)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons (45 ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons (5 g) chopped fresh thyme, plus 6 sprigs</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>12 ounces (340 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into sheets about ⅟₃₂ inch (0.8 mm) thick</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons (85 g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 canned whole San Marzano tomatoes</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons (3 g) grated lemon zest</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together the branzino, oil, and chopped thyme in a bowl. Season the mixture with salt and pepper, and then chill for 15 to 30 minutes to marinate. Transfer to a pastry bag, if you like.</li>
            <li>Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the edges square. Cut the sheet in half lengthwise, then pipe or spoon ½- to ¾-inch (12 mm to 2 cm) balls of filling down the entire length of each strip, leaving a 1¼-inch (4 cm) margin around each ball. Lightly mist the dough with water to keep it from drying out and to help create a good seal. Fold the long edge of the pasta closest to you over a row of filling. Fold the opposite long edge over the other row of filling. Use your fingers to press out the air around each ball of filling. Using a round cutter 1¾ to 2 inches (4.5 to 5 cm) in diameter, cut out half-moons by positioning the cutter halfway over the filling. Repeat the process with the remaining pasta and filling. As the ravioli are formed, transfer them to floured rimmed baking sheets. You should have 80 to 90 ravioli.</li>
            <li>Cover the ravioli and use them within 1 hour or refrigerate them for up to 4 hours. You can also freeze the ravioli in a single layer, transfer them to zipper-lock bags, and freeze them for up to 2 weeks. Take the ravioli right from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches to prevent crowding, drop in the ravioli and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a low boil. Gently cook the ravioli until they are tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. Add the tomatoes, crushing them with your hands as you add them to the pan. Add the thyme sprigs and ¾ cup (177 ml) of the pasta water and cook the mixture until it reduces in volume slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the ravioli and transfer them directly to the pan and sauce. Toss gently until the sauce gets creamy and coats the pasta, 1 to 2 minutes. Taste the sauce, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Remove the pan from the heat and keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan.</li>
            <li>Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates, arranging the ravioli nicely on each plate. Garnish with the lemon zest.</li>
        </ol>
