            <p>You can make versions of this dish with all sorts of seafood and various citrus pastas like lemon, orange, or lime. Use seafood that can be just warmed through like crab meat, shrimp, lobster meat, shucked clams or mussels, or white fish such as monkfish. Try shrimp and orange pasta—the combination works great.</p>

            <strong>Pasta Swap:</strong> You need a long, delicate pasta here. Linguine or pappardelle would work.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound (454 g) sea scallops, preferably unsoaked diver scallops, diced</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">40 fresh basil leaves (about ½ cup packed/22 g), cut into chiffonade</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (237 ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ Vidalia onion, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced crosswise</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 canned whole San Marzano tomatoes</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound (454 g) Lemon Dough, rolled into sheets about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Stir together the scallops, basil, and all but 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the oil in a large bowl. Taste the mixture, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you (scallops are one of the safest shellfish to eat raw). Cover and marinate the mixture at room temperature for at least 1 hour or in the refrigerator for up to 4 hours.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons (30 ml) oil in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onion and sweat it until tender but not browned, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, crushing them with your hand as you add them to the pan. Turn down the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally until the flavors have blended and the tomatoes lose their canned taste, about 40 minutes. Taste the sauce, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Use the sauce within 1 hour or refrigerate it in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the edges square. Cut the sheet into 9-inch (23 cm) lengths. Fit your stand mixer or pasta machine with the fettuccine cutter and set it to medium speed. Feed 1 length of dough at a time through the cutter, dusting the dough lightly with flour as it is cut into strands. Coil the fettuccine into nests and set them on a floured rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining sheets. Use the fettuccine within 1 hour or freeze it in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water, adding 30 seconds or so to the cooking time.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the fettuccine, cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil, and cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the pasta by transferring it to the pan of tomato sauce. Reserve the pasta water.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add 1 cup (237 ml) of the pasta water and the scallop mixture to the pan and cook over medium heat, tossing until the sauce reduces slightly, becomes creamy, and coats the pasta, 2 to 3 minutes. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates.</li>
        </ol>
