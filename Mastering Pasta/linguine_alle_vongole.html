        <h1>Linguine alle Vongole</h1>
        <p class="servings">Makes 4 servings</p>
        
        <p>If I had to a pick a favorite recipe in this book, this might be it. The combination of briny, creamy, soft, and chewy just does it for me. The sauce is basically wine, olive oil, and clam juice, so it takes a while to emulsify, but just keep tossing and it will eventually get creamy. And go heavy on the parsley. It adds unbelievable freshness.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>PASTA SWAP:</strong> I make this with strozzapreti (see page 199) all the time. That shape is shorter and chunkier but still nice and chewy.

        <div class="ingredients">
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>12 ounces (340 g) Extruded Semolina Dough</li>
                <li>Semolina, for dusting</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons (90 ml) olive oil</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
                <li>4 pounds (1.8 kg) Manila clams or cockles, scrubbed and rinsed (about 8 cups/2 L)</li>
                <li>1½ cups (296 ml) dry white wine</li>
                <li>1¼ cups (296 ml) water</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons (90 ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>⅓ cup (16 g) chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon (0.3 g) red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="instructions">
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Fit your pasta extruder or stand-mixer attachment with the chilled linguine plate. If using a pasta extruder, set it to medium speed. If using a stand mixer, with the machine running on medium speed, feed the dough into the hopper in marble-size clumps, using a pushing tool to push the clumps into the auger, being careful not to overload it. As the pasta is extruded, cut it into 9-inch (23 cm) lengths and immediately dust it with semolina to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Dry the pasta by placing it on wire racks that will fit in your refrigerator and refrigerate it uncovered for at least 8 hours or up to 4 days. The pasta will get drier and harder as it sits. I like the texture after 2 days in the refrigerator. For more bite, dry the pasta with a humidifier as described on page 120, and then store it in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 month.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the linguine, cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil, and cook the pasta until it is almost tender but still quite chewy when bitten, 3 to 4 minutes (6 to 8 minutes for fully dried boxed pasta). Drain the pasta and reserve the pasta water.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat the olive oil and garlic in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. When the garlic starts to sizzle, add the clams. Remove the pan from the heat (to prevent a flare-up) and add the wine and water. Return the pan to the heat, cover it, and cook the clams until they open, 4 to 5 minutes. Discard any clams that do not open.</li>
                <li>Add the drained pasta to the pan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring gently, until the pasta absorbs some of the liquid and feels tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the extra-virgin olive oil, parsley, and pepper flakes. The parsley adds fresh flavor, but I like to soften the leaves a bit in the sauce.</li>
                <li>To make the pasta easier to toss, scoop out about half of the clams from their shells and return their meat to the pan (discard the empty shells). Toss the pasta and sauce until the sauce reduces slightly, gets creamy, and coats the pasta, about 1 minute. Add some of the reserved pasta water if necessary to create a creamy sauce. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt until it tastes good to you.</li>
                <li>Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates.</li>
