            <p>Compared with other pasta dishes, this one forms a slightly thicker robe of sauce around the pasta. The sauce is almost like a savory crème anglaise—super rich and creamy. Just cook it slowly so you don't curdle the eggs. Very slowly. That's the biggest problem with carbonara. This dish should not taste like scrambled eggs. Just be patient. The eggs will eventually thicken up and make the sauce ultracreamy. Trust me. The results are worth it.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Pasta Swap:</strong> Garganelli comes from the word garganel, which means "chicken's gullet" or esophagus. It's the perfect shape for sucking up sauce. You could also use fatter tubes like paccheri or longer, skinnier tubes like bucatini. As long as you choose a big, chewy pasta, it will go well with the creamy sauce.
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound (454 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into sheets about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (227 g) pancetta, diced</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (160 g) finely chopped white onion</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 eggs, well beaten</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2½ cups (250 g) grated Parmesan cheese, plus some for garnish (optional)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the edges square. Cut the sheet into 2-inch (5 cm) squares. Place a garganelli comb or gnocchi board on your work surface with the lines running perpendicular to the edge of the surface, or securely tape a large, clean fine-toothed pocket comb to a clean edge of the surface. Flour it lightly. To form each garganelli, place a square of pasta on the comb or gnocchi board so one of the corners is pointing in the same direction as the teeth of the comb. Lay a wooden dowel ¼ inch (6 mm) in diameter (or use a clean pencil) and lay it over the pasta perpendicular to the teeth of the comb. Fold the bottom corner of the pasta over the dowel, then roll the pasta loosely onto the dowel, roll back and forth on the comb or board a couple of times, pressing gently into the ridges of the comb to seal the edges of the pasta and create a ridged quill shape similar to penne. Slide the pasta off the dowel and set it on a floured rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining sheets. Dust the tubes with flour, cover them, and use them within 1 hour or refrigerate them for up to 4 hours. You can also freeze them in a single layer, transfer them to a zipper-lock bag, and freeze them for up to 1 month. Take the pasta right from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a bowl. Drop in the garganelli and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, about 2 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, cook the pancetta in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat until it renders its fat and starts to brown lightly, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the onion and cook it until it is tender, 3 to 4 minutes. When the pasta is ready, using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the pasta by transferring it to the pan of pancetta and onion. Reserve the pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add 2 cups (473 ml) of the pasta water to the pan and cook the mixture over medium-high heat, tossing and stirring vigorously, until the sauce reduces slightly, gets creamy, and coats the pasta, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs and cook gently over medium-low heat, tossing and stirring, until the eggs thicken and create a velvety sauce, 2 to 3 minutes. The eggs should not scramble and form curds; they should thicken and create a creamy sauce. When the sauce is creamy, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the Parmesan. Keep the pasta moving until the cheese melts and pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates and garnish each serving with additional Parmesan, if you like.</li>
        </ol>
