            <p>Some of the flavor combinations push the boundaries, but most of them are pretty classic. Lamb, peas, and mint taste awesome together, and there's no need to mess with that combination. But you could switch around what appears here. The peas are in the dough in this recipe, but you could make Mint Dough (page 145) instead.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="instructions">
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol itemprop="recipeInstructions">
                <li><strong>Make the Pasta:</strong> Fit your pasta extruder or stand-mixer attachment with the malloreddus (gnocchi sardi) plate. Set the extruder to medium speed; if using a stand-mixer attachment, feed the dough into the extruder in marble-size clumps, using a pushing tool to push the clumps through the extruder. The first few clumps may come out uneven; just throw them away. Continue gradually dropping marble-size clumps into the extruder and pushing them through, being careful not to overload it. As the pasta is extruded, cut it into ¾-inch (2 cm) lengths and immediately dust it with semolina to prevent sticking.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Hand-Shape Alternative:</strong> You can also shape the pasta by hand. Form the dough into a ball, adding a little water if necessary, then roll out the ball into a few ropes. On a lightly floured work surface, roll each piece into a rope ⅛ inch (6 mm) in diameter, then cut each rope crosswise into ¼-inch (6 mm) pieces. Roll each piece on a grooved gnocchi board or the back of fork tines to create a ridged oval shape similar to, though a little shorter than, cavatelli.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Dry the Pasta:</strong> Dry the pasta by placing it on wire racks that will fit in your refrigerator and refrigerate it uncovered for at least 8 hours or up to 4 days. The pasta will get drier and harder as it sits. The texture is perfect after 2 days in the refrigerator.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Prepare the Meat Grinder:</strong> Put a bowl and all of the parts of a meat grinder in the freezer for 20 minutes. Put the lamb and fatback in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and freeze until very cold, about 20 minutes.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Grind the Meat:</strong> Grind the lamb and fatback on the medium die of the meat grinder into the cold bowl. Season with salt and pepper and stir to mix in the seasonings.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Prepare the Herb Bundle:</strong> Tie the herb sprigs, peppercorns, coriander seeds, and garlic cloves in a cheesecloth bundle.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Brown the Meat:</strong> Heat a large, deep sauté pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add the oil, swirling to coat the pan. Add the meat mixture and let it cook undisturbed until the meat is deeply browned on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape up and stir the meat, continuing to cook until it is browned all over, another 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Add Vegetables and Wine:</strong> Add the onion and carrot and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in the wine and deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits on the pan bottom. Boil over high heat until the wine nearly evaporates, 5 to 6 minutes, then add the tomato puree and cheesecloth bundle.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Simmer the Ragù:</strong> Turn down the heat to low, cover, and gently simmer the meat until it is extremely tender, 1½ to 2 hours. The ragù should be mostly meat with barely any liquid left in the pan. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Use within 2 hours or cover and refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Blanch the Peas:</strong> Have ready a bowl of ice water. Bring a small saucepan filled with water to a boil. Drop the peas into the boiling water and blanch them until they are bright green, about 30 seconds. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, immediately transfer the peas to the ice water to stop the cooking. Let the peas stand in the ice water until you are ready to use them.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the pasta and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Warm the Peas:</strong> Meanwhile, using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, transfer the blanched peas to the ragù and stir until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Finish the Dish:</strong> Using the spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the pasta by transferring it to the ragù. Reserve the pasta water. Add ½ cup (118 ml) of the pasta water and the butter to the pan and stir until the sauce reduces slightly, gets creamy, and coats the pasta, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in ¼ cup (25 g) of the Parmesan. Keep the pasta moving until the cheese melts and the pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates and garnish with the remaining Parmesan and the mint.</li>
