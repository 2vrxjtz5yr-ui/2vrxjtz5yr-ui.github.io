            <p>This long, square strand pasta is named chitarra (Italian for "guitar") because it's cut on a pasta-cutting tool called a chitarra that has metal strings resembling guitar strings. At Vetri, we make this ragù with whole veal shins or shanks weighing 5 to 6 pounds (2.3 to 2.7 kg) each. But you can use shanks that have been cut every 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) across the bone, known as osso buco cut, which are much easier to find. If you like, add some other aromatics to the braise, such as bay leaf, garlic, or herbs like thyme or rosemary. Sometimes I soften up a long strip of lemon zest in hot water, then twist it over the top as a garnish.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 pounds (2.3 kg) veal shins or shanks, trimmed of excess fat and membrane</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Tipo 00 flour or all-purpose flour, for dusting veal shins</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (30 ml) grapeseed or canola oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 yellow onion, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 carrots, peeled and coarsely chopped</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 celery stalks, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 pound (454 g) Whole Egg and Semolina Dough (page 29), rolled into sheets about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (114 g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (8 g) chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (112 g) grated pecorino al tartufo cheese (truffle pecorino)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ teaspoons (3 g) grated lemon zest</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oven to 200°F (95°C). Season the shins all over with salt and pepper and then dust them with the flour, shaking off the excess. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, working in batches to prevent crowding, add the shins and cook them, turning them now and then, until they are deeply browned all over, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the shins to a plate.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Turn down the heat to medium and add the onion, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are nicely browned and caramelized, 5 to 7 minutes. Return the shins to the pan, then add water to come about two-thirds of the way up the sides of the shins. Cover the pan and braise in the oven until the meat pulls easily off the bone, 12 to 14 hours.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the pan from the oven and let the mixture cool in the pan. When cool enough to handle, remove the shins and pull off the meat from the bones, discarding the bones and any fat and gristle. Be vigilant. There will be tendons and pockets of chewy stuff that you want to discard. Shred the meat and set it aside. Pass the liquid and vegetables through a food mill fitted with the large die into a large, deep sauté pan, or pulse them briefly in a food processor just until the vegetables are finely chopped but not puréed, then transfer to a large, deep sauté pan. If the ragù mixture looks thin and watery, place the pan over high heat and boil it until it has a consistency of tomato sauce. Return the meat to the ragù and then taste the mixture, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. You should have about 4 cups (946 ml) ragù. Use the ragù within a few hours or transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to 3 days or freeze it for up to 2 months.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Generously dust the sheet with flour, and then cut the sheet into pieces the length and width of your chitarra. Lay a piece lengthwise on the strings of the chitarra and roll a floured rolling pin back and forth over the pasta to press it into the strings (see photos, page 192). If the pasta doesn't cut all the way through, dust the surface and pasta a bit more with flour and roll the pin over the pasta again.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the fettuccine, in batches if necessary to prevent crowding, and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, heat 4 to 5 cups (1 to 1.2 L) of the ragù in a large, deep sauté pan (or 2 pans if necessary) over medium heat. Reserve any remaining ragù for another use; it can be frozen for up to 1 month. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the pasta by transferring it to the pan of ragù. Reserve the pasta water. Add the butter, oil, and lemon zest and juice to the pan, tossing the mixture until the sauce reduces slightly, gets creamy, and coats the pasta, 1 to 2 minutes. Add a little pasta water if necessary to create a creamy sauce. Remove the pan(s) from the heat and keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan(s). Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates and garnish with the Parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
