            <p>While writing this book, I asked my chef de cuisine, Adam Leonti, how he came up with this dish. He told me, "It's your dish. Remember that pescatarian who came in one night?" Then it all came back to me. The guest didn't eat meat—only fish—but she wasn't impressed by the variety of fish on our menu at the time. I opened up the fridge and saw a Dungeness crab. I knew that we had just bought some fantastic burrata, so I made a pasta dish with the crab and the cheese. Fazzoletti means "handkerchiefs," and these little squares of pasta fold over themselves, the crab, and the burrata in a beautiful way. The old rule that says "no cheese with seafood" has always been a mystery to me. You can have cheese with seafood. A gentle burrata adds tremendous texture and flavor to the crab here. For a sharper punch of flavor, substitute sorrel for the parsley. By the way, the pescatarian left very happy!</p>

            <strong>Pasta Swap:</strong> This combination also works great in lasagna. Use the Heirloom Tomato and Burrata Lasagna (page 68) as a starting point, and then make layers with the crab, burrata, and pasta.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces (340 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into sheets about 1⁄16 inch (1.5 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">⅓ cup (180 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">⅓ cup (56 g) finely chopped yellow onion</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces (340 g) jumbo lump crabmeat, picked over to remove any shells and cartilage</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (8 g) chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus some for garnish</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon (15 ml) fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 ounces (170 g) burrata cheese</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (6 g) chopped fresh chives, plus some for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the ends square. Cut the sheet into 2½- to 3-inch (6 to 7.5 cm) squares and dust them lightly with flour. Repeat with the remaining sheets. You should have 60 to 70 fazzoletti. You can use the fazzoletti immediately, or you can freeze them in a single layer on a floured rimmed baking sheet, transfer them to a zipper-lock bag, and freeze them for up to 1 month. Take the pasta right from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a bowl. Drop in the fazzoletti, in batches if necessary to prevent crowding, and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, about 2 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onion and sweat it until it is soft but not browned, 2 to 3 minutes. When the pasta is ready, using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the pasta by transferring it to the pan of onions. Reserve the pasta water. Add about 1 cup (237 ml) of the pasta water to the pan and stir vigorously over medium-high heat until the liquid reduces and thickens slightly, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add the crabmeat, parsley, chives, and lemon juice and cook over medium-low heat, tossing and stirring vigorously, until the sauce becomes creamy and coats the pasta, about 1 minute. Add a little more pasta water if necessary to create a creamy sauce. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the burrata. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. The cheese should just start to get warm and melty. Taste the pasta, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates and garnish with a grind of pepper and some parsley and chives.</li>
        </ol>
