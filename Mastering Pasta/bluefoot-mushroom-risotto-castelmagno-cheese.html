        <p itemprop="description">This isn't a traditional mushroom risotto with the mushrooms left whole or maybe halved or quartered. I finely chop them to about the same size as the rice grains. The dish ends up looking like a Bolognese sauce, and you get amazing mushroom flavor in every bite. If you can't find bluefoot mushrooms, use matsutake or shiitake mushrooms. Grated Castelmagno and a drizzle of vincotto add pungency and sweetness to the whole thing.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup (118 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces (340 g) bluefoot mushrooms, finely chopped</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">¾ cup (126 g) finely chopped yellow onion</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">5 cups (1.2 L) boiling water</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (195 g) Carnaroli rice</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">⅓ cup (78 ml) dry white wine</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 tablespoons (85 g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">4 ounces (114 g) Castelmagno cheese, grated (about 1 cup)</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 teaspoon (5 ml) vincotto (page 245)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat ¼ cup (60 ml) of the oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and ½ cup (84 g) of the onion and cook them until the mushrooms begin to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Add 1 cup (237 ml) of the boiling water, bring it to a simmer, and simmer until the liquid evaporates and the mushrooms are deeply browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Taste the mixture, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Transfer the mixture to a plate.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of oil in the same pan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the remaining ¼ cup (42 g) onion and sweat the onion until it is soft but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add the rice and sauté the rice until it is translucent around the edges and starts to brown a little, 2 to 3 minutes. This is an important step to develop the right flavor and texture in the rice; make sure the rice absorbs some of the oil. Add the mushroom mixture and the wine and simmer until the pan goes dry, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Gradually add the remaining boiling water about ½ cup (118 ml) at a time, stirring almost constantly over medium-high heat until the rice absorbs the water after each addition. When the rice is done, it should be tender but still a little chewy when bitten and have released most of its starch, creating a creamy sauce in the pan. This process will take 25 to 30 minutes. Near the end of cooking, add a little more water if necessary and stir the rice like crazy to release as much starch as possible and create the sauce. Drag your spoon through the rice to the bottom of the pan; the sauce should slowly fill in the line you made.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter, the remaining 2 tablespoons (30 ml) oil, and ¾ cup (84 g) of the cheese to create a creamy but not too loose sauce. Taste the risotto, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the risotto onto warmed plates. Garnish with the remaining Castelmagno and drizzle with the vincotto.</li>
        </ol>
