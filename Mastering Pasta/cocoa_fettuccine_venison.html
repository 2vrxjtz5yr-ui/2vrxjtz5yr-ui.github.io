        <h1>Cocoa Fettuccine with Venison Ragù</h1>
        <p class="servings">Makes 8 servings</p>
        
        <p>A little cocoa in a game ragù helps to calm down any gamey taste in the meat. Here, I put the cocoa in the pasta instead. I usually make this ragù with a whole venison leg that weighs about 10 pounds (4.5 kg). But you need a big pan to cook the whole leg, so we tested this recipe with smaller venison shanks. They worked perfectly. You could also use venison shoulder.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>PASTA SWAP:</strong> Chestnut Dough tastes delicious here, or try the Farro Semolina Dough, extruded into strands such as spaghetti.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 pounds (1.8 kg) bone-in venison shanks or shoulder</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>Tipo 00 flour or all-purpose flour, for dusting venison</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons (30 ml) grapeseed or canola oil</li>
                <li>4 carrots, peeled and cut into large pieces</li>
                <li>2 celery stalks, cut into large pieces</li>
                <li>1 large yellow onion, cut into large pieces</li>
                <li>½ cup (114 g) unsalted butter</li>
                <li>½ cup (118 ml) olive oil</li>
                <li>Grated zest and juice of 2 small lemons</li>
                <li>1 pound (454 g) Cocoa Dough, rolled into sheets about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick</li>
                <li>½ cup (50 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="instructions">
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oven to 200°F (95°C), or to 160°F (70°C) if it can be set that low. Season the venison all over with salt and pepper, and then dust it with flour, shaking off the excess. Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a large Dutch oven or in a flameproof roasting pan big enough to accommodate the venison. Add the venison and cook it, turning it as each side is browned, until it is deeply browned all over, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the venison to a large plate and set it aside.</li>
                <li>Turn down the heat to medium, add the carrots, celery, and onion to the pan, and cook, stirring now and then, until nicely browned, about 15 minutes. Return the venison to the pan and pour in enough water to come about three-fourths of the way up the sides of the venison. Cover the pan (with aluminum foil if you don't have a lid) and braise the meat in the oven until it is so tender that the meat pulls easily off the bone, 7 to 8 hours.</li>
                <li>Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the venison to a cutting board. When the venison is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bones, discarding the bones. Shred or chop the meat into bite-size pieces and set aside.</li>
                <li>Pass the vegetables and braising liquid through a food mill fitted with the medium die, or pulse them briefly in a food processor just until the vegetables are coarsely chopped. Return the ragù to the pan; if it looks watery, simmer it over medium-low heat until it is somewhat thick. Stir in the meat and reheat gently over medium-low heat. Taste the mixture, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you. Use the ragù within 1 hour or refrigerate it in an airtight container for up to 1 week.</li>
                <li>Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface and trim the edges square. Cut the sheet into 9-inch (23 cm) lengths. Fit your stand mixer or pasta machine with the fettuccine cutter and set it to medium speed. Feed 1 length of dough at a time through the cutter, dusting the dough lightly with flour as it is cut into strands. Form the fettuccine into nests and set them on a floured rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. Use the fettuccine within 1 hour or freeze it in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Take the pasta straight from the freezer to the boiling pasta water, adding 30 seconds or so to the cooking time.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the fettuccine, cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil, and cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the pasta by transferring it to the pan of ragù. Reserve the pasta water.</li>
                <li>Add 1 cup (237 ml) of the pasta water and the butter, tossing until the sauce reduces slightly, gets creamy, and coats the pasta, 3 to 4 minutes. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan, adding a little more pasta water if necessary to create a creamy sauce. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
                <li>Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates and garnish with the Parmesan.</li>
