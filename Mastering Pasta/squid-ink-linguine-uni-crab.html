            <p>Uni (sea urchin) has an incredible texture. It makes a creamy sauce and almost behaves like fat in a dish, even though it's actually pretty low in fat. But you have to be careful; as with fat, too much is not a good thing. Look for West Coast uni; it's bigger and creamier than East Coast uni.</p>

            <strong>Pasta Swap:</strong> Spaghetti or bucatini would be good, but keep it flavored with squid ink. The black pasta and orange sauce help make this dish what it is.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">12 ounces (340 g) Squid Ink Semolina Dough (page 121)</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Semolina, for dusting</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">16 pieces cleaned uni (about 10 oz/283 g or ¾ cup)</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 tablespoons (90 ml) olive oil</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons (28 g) peeled and minced carrot</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons (20 g) minced celery</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons (32 g) minced yellow onion</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 ounces (85 g) jumbo lump crabmeat, picked over to remove any shells and cartilage</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (6 g) chopped fresh chives</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon (15 ml) fresh lemon juice</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Fit your pasta extruder or stand-mixer attachment with the linguine plate. Set the extruder to medium speed; if using a stand-mixer attachment, feed the dough into the extruder in marble-size clumps, using a pushing tool to push the clumps through the extruder. The first few clumps may come out uneven; just throw them away. Continue gradually dropping marble-size clumps into the extruder and pushing them through, being careful not to overload it. As the pasta is extruded, cut it into 9-inch (23 cm) lengths and immediately dust it with semolina to prevent sticking.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dry the pasta by placing it on wire racks that will fit in your refrigerator and refrigerate it uncovered for at least 8 hours or up to 4 days. The pasta will get drier and harder as it sits. The texture is perfect after 2 days in the refrigerator.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the linguine and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook until the pasta is tender yet firm, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Meanwhile, mash the uni in a mortar with a pestle or process in a food processor until coarsely pureed. Heat the oil in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the carrot, celery, and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 seconds.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the pasta by transferring it to the pan. Reserve the pasta water. Add the uni, crabmeat, chives, lemon juice, and ½ cup (118 ml) of the pasta water to the pan and toss and stir until the sauce reduces slightly, gets creamy, and coats the pasta, 1 to 2 minutes. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>

            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates.</li>
        </ol>
