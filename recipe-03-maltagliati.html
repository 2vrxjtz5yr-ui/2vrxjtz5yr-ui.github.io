            <p>There are only a couple of differences between this sauce and the tomato and basil sauce on page 124. Each starts with tomatoes and garlic sweated in olive oil, but the arrabbiata gets punched up with red pepper flakes and the herb is parsley—a fair amount of it. Otherwise, they're both simple, straightforward sautés of tomatoes and aromatics. The pasta here is scraps of freshly rolled egg pasta. Use leftovers from making another pasta, or use fresh sheets and cut them into irregular rectangles, diamonds, squares, triangles, or whatever. Maltagliati means "badly cut," so don't make them too perfect, or too big or too long. About 3 inches (7.5 cm) square is right. If you opt for dried pasta, use about 2 cups (150 g) of a short shape. And add as much red pepper flakes as you like. It's not arrabbiata without some kick.</p>

            <strong>Pasta Swap:</strong> So many pastas work in this dish. I use maltagliati to make it more luxurious. But you can easily used dried penne, ziti, or another short shape to make it more traditional.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">⅓ cup (60 ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 clove garlic, smashed</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 cup (240 g) whole canned San Marzano tomatoes</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">8 ounces (227 g) Egg Yolk Dough (page 26), rolled into sheets about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ teaspoon (0.5 g) red pepper flakes</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">3 tablespoons (11 g) chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">2 tablespoons (13 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Heat the oil and garlic in a large, deep sauté pan over medium heat. Keep the heat to medium so you don't burn the garlic. A little brown is okay. After about 2 minutes, add the tomatoes, crushing them with your hand as you add them to the pan. Lower the heat to medium-low and cook the tomatoes until they lose their raw, acidic flavor, about 10 minutes.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Lay a pasta sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Cut the sheet into irregular shapes about 3 inches (7.5 cm) square. This pasta is traditionally made from pasta scraps, so the pieces should not be perfect. Cut them any which way. Repeat with the second sheet. Dust the pieces with flour, cover them, and use them within 1 hour or refrigerate them for up to 4 hours. You can also freeze them in a single layer, transfer them to a zipper-lock bag, and freeze them for up to 1 month. Take the pasta right from the freezer to the boiling pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the maltagliati and cover the pot to quickly return the water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is tender but still a little chewy when bitten, about 2 minutes. Using a spider strainer or slotted spoon, drain the pasta by transferring it to the pan of tomato sauce. Reserve the pasta water.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add ½ cup (118 ml) of the pasta water, the pepper flakes, and the parsley to the pan and cook over medium-high heat, tossing and stirring vigorously, until the sauce reduces slightly, becomes creamy, and coats the pasta, about 1 minute. Keep the pasta moving until pasta and sauce become one thing in the pan. Taste it, adding salt and pepper until it tastes good to you.</li>
            
            <li itemprop="recipeInstructions">Dish out the pasta onto warmed plates and garnish each serving with some of the Parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
